## Home and family

The girl starts at the local university shortly. Otherwise there's little news on the home front. The ADU is occupied and concerns about water quality have been handled; now to deal with a little water creeping out under the shower door. For some reason my nice skate wheel desk chair wheels are drawing on the hardwood floor. They should not be doing that.

## Work

Invoca always needs something different, but always needs the same thing – a clear and mutually-understood view of the customer goal we hope to address and the user needs that intersect it. Coordinated AI-powered experiences are new for this team, and it's up to me to set the guidelines and guardrails.

## Body

Driving for a couple of hours to and from a camping trip leaves me stiff and gimpy for a moment until I've hobbled around a bit and things loosen up. But lifting, hiking, calesthenics, exercise in general is dandy. Getting old is…weird.
