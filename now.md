## Home

It's hot out, and cool in, thanks in part to our happy landscaping, our new curtains and blinds, and renewed interest in closing up the house before the cool inside is wasted.

## Family

Full house! While the girl is off in another state, the ADU is now occupied and everyone seems to be settling in nicely.

## Work

Invoca always needs something different, but always needs the same thing â€“ a clear and mutually-understood view of the customer goal we hope to address and the user needs that intersect it. Coordinated AI-powered experiences are new for this team, and it's up to me to set the guidelines and guardrails.

## Body

After a bunch of minor setbacks (back pain, a groin pull, shoulder and elbow tendinitis) I'm still pulling a 400lb deadlift every week. Not going backwards, not really progressing. But I'm being gentle with myself and will crack 410 again soon. The yoga is helping.
