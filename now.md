# /now
(updated {{ date | postDate }})

I'm currently experimenting with

* AI-powered design tools
* bringing AI "workflow agent" ideas to the platform
* what's the least effective dose of rebranding/reskinning
* Cursor use as a lapsed coder (I've not really worked with code since the echo of the first dot-com boom, so there's a lot to catch up on)

I'm currently pushing on

* shared goals and goal maintenance
* multi-concept workflow
* the purpose of different kinds of releases
* what's "complete" for each type
* what's "quality" for each type
* getting all trio members into some regular contact with customers

Y'know, the basics…

And I'm deadlifting 435 for two. Not bad!
