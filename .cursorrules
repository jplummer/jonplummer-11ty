# Project-Specific Rules

This file contains project-specific rules for this Eleventy site. Universal rules are configured in Cursor User Rules.

## 11ty-specific
- Prefer Nunjucks (.njk) for templates.
- Follow the established _posts/YYYY/ directory structure for posts.
- Include required front matter: title, date, layout, tags (posts must include `post` in tags array).
- Use ISO date format: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss-HH:mm".
- Full Eleventy documentation is available in `docs/reference/eleventy/docs/`. Reference these docs when implementing 11ty features, especially for data files, filters, collections, pagination, and configuration.
    - When working with 11ty-specific functionality, search the documentation first before guessing or assuming behavior.

## JavaScript/Node.js
- Use CommonJS (require/module.exports) for scripts.
- Include shebang for executable scripts: #!/usr/bin/env node.
- Handle errors gracefully with try-catch.
- Use fs and path modules for file operations.
- Exit with appropriate codes (0 for success, 1 for failure).

## Content Guidelines
- Write clear, engaging titles.
- Use descriptive image filenames.
- Include meta descriptions for SEO (50-160 characters).
- Use proper markdown syntax.
- Keep paragraphs concise and scannable.
