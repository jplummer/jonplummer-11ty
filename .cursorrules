# Project-Specific Rules

This file contains project-specific rules for this Eleventy site. Universal rules are configured in Cursor User Rules (accessible via Cursor Settings → Rules for AI, or Command Palette → "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)" and look for `cursor.aiRules`).

## 11ty-specific
- Prefer Nunjucks (.njk) for templates.
- Follow the established _posts/YYYY/ directory structure for posts.
- Include required front matter: title, date, layout, tags (posts must include `post` in tags array).
- Use ISO date format: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss-HH:mm".

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Check Eleventy Documentation Before Implementing Features
**MANDATORY WORKFLOW**: Before implementing ANY Eleventy feature, filter, collection, data file, pagination, or configuration:
1. **FIRST**: Search `docs/eleventy/` using `codebase_search` to find if Eleventy supports it natively
2. **THEN**: Read the relevant documentation file(s) using `read_file`
3. **ONLY THEN**: Implement using Eleventy's built-in capabilities

**DO NOT**:
- Reimplement standard Eleventy features (pagination, collections, data cascade, date functions, filters, shortcodes)
- Write custom code for features Eleventy provides natively
- Guess or assume behavior - always check the docs first

Use `codebase_search` with queries like "How does Eleventy handle [feature]?" targeting `docs/eleventy/` to find relevant documentation dynamically.

## JavaScript/Node.js
- Use CommonJS (require/module.exports) for scripts.
- Include shebang for executable scripts: #!/usr/bin/env node.
- Handle errors gracefully with try-catch.
- Use fs and path modules for file operations.
- Exit with appropriate codes (0 for success, 1 for failure).

## Content Guidelines
- Write clear, engaging titles.
- Use descriptive image filenames.
- Include meta descriptions for SEO (50-160 characters).
- Use proper markdown syntax.
- Keep paragraphs concise and scannable.
