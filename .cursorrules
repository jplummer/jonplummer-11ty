# Project-Specific Rules

This file contains project-specific rules for this Eleventy site. Universal rules are configured in Cursor User Rules (accessible via Cursor Settings → Rules for AI, or Command Palette → "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)" and look for `cursor.aiRules`).

## 11ty-specific
- Prefer Nunjucks (.njk) for templates.
- Follow the established _posts/YYYY/ directory structure for posts.
- Include required front matter: title, date, layout, tags (posts must include `post` in tags array).
- Use ISO date format: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss-HH:mm".

### 🔍 CRITICAL: Debugging Unexpected Behavior

**When encountering unexpected behavior, follow the debugging workflow:**

1. **ASSUME ELEVENTY IS WORKING CORRECTLY** - Most "bugs" are misunderstandings of Eleventy's behavior
2. **Read `docs/ELEVENTY-DEBUGGING-WORKFLOW.md`** - This contains the systematic debugging process
3. **Use Eleventy's debug mode** - Run `DEBUG=Eleventy* pnpm run build` to see what Eleventy is doing
4. **Only then consider custom code** - After verifying Eleventy doesn't provide this, ask user before implementing

**Common mistake**: Writing workarounds for behavior that is actually Eleventy working as designed.

## JavaScript/Node.js
- Use CommonJS (require/module.exports) for scripts.
- Include shebang for executable scripts: #!/usr/bin/env node.
- Handle errors gracefully with try-catch.
- Use fs and path modules for file operations.
- Exit with appropriate codes (0 for success, 1 for failure).

## Content Guidelines
- Write clear, engaging titles.
- Use descriptive image filenames.
- Include meta descriptions for SEO (50-160 characters).
- Use proper markdown syntax.
- Keep paragraphs concise and scannable.
