- It wasn't COVID-19, just a sinus infection that dripped into crevices and alarmed passers-by. I'm nearly 100% now.
- Nothing caught on fire while I was out.

Since my last real coding experience was a bunch of kooky javascript stuff around the turn of the century I'm well out of my depth, but it's both fun and frustrating; there's a point at which I'm familiar, I'm familiar, I'm familiar with the concepts in a tutorial and then _whap_ I'm met with something totally baffling.
