In spite of the organization's urges to snap back to old ways (ways that got us to where we are, so are not sufficient on their own to change our results):

- My people are not overreacting to the politics…
- …assisted by their work in making us more customer-centric being shouted-out in public forums by the CEO…
- …who is also publicly mentioning themes that have been part of my mission at the company since I was hired.

This all is setting me up perfectly to talk about quality and how the product needs to change (i.e. what we need to organize ourselves to produce) at the offsite after Thanksgiving.

Also,

- I'm in the interview panel for the new product leader for a key product.

Interesting times!
