- We've finished emptying our storage unit! That's money that no longer needs to fly out the door each month. And I've repacked several boxes that were collapsing, making it possible to stack better, be more organized, and pass on some things that others will like but that we don't need.
- Our landlord found a service that refurbishes old control boards and shipped them the display and relay boards from our oven. The oven display will be working again when he returns on Tuesday.
- Better insoles fixed my favorite hiking shoes – no impassioned argument for a return needed.
- The girl's dance team won first place at her competition this weekend. Good job, ladies!
