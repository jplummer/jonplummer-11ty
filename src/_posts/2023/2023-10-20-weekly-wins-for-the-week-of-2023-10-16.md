A grab bag:
- An end-to-end demo of a hard-fought project went pretty well. We're functionally close, but far from where we need to be in terms of a professional-looking and -acting feature.
- The Huskies won. As a Dawg in duckburg I'm torn – should I buy an away jersey (white) to wear around town or a home jersey (purple)?
- New mentees continue to appear. Some of them aren't actually mentees but doing a little market or product research, but I don't mind as long as their questions are relevant to my interests. It's a tough time for entry-level UX people, but I hope I am helpful to them with my seemingly slightly-offbeat advice. Remember, it's the designer's job to do _the right thing_ with the feedback they receive.
