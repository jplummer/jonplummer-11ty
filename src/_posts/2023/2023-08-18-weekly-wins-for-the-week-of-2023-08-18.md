- Quarterly coaching was straightforward and is nearly done. Only one person has not yet submitted their self-eval, and they have a good excuse.
- UX is on the critical path of a key project, but not as badly as suspected, and solid progress is being made.
- We can chalk some recent process difficulties up to leadership issues, not crew issues. This is fab, because responsibility is squarely placed.
- One new mentee relationship and one old one have reminded me of good things to write about; watch this space.
