Be it version three or an MVP, the experience we deliver should

- be valuable to specific users
- be usable by those users
- conform to or enhance the user's understanding of the subject area
- be pleasant to use
- be visually polished
- deliver value in results and conveniences
- minimize toil
- be complete in its delivery of the uses we offer
- be complete in its states, messages, and errors
- make good use of familiar controls and interaction paradigms
- make success obvious
- be obvious in expected actions and right action
- be self-explanatory, relying on recognition rather than training and recall
- be well-labeled
- be instrumented so we can witness users' successes and difficulties

…even if the scope is small, even if it's a little slice of functionality from a bigger, longer-term plan, even if it is a fragment of the excellent future we envision. Even the basics should be built completely, with thoughtfulness and pride.
