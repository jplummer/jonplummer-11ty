- I installed a bluetooth kit behind the factory car stereo in the 2006 Matrix and
  - it worked on the first try,
  - it sounds great,
  - pairing was easy and the connection seems reliable, and
  - in doing so I accidentally fixed the clock.
  - I also found a decent way to plug the hole in the dash left by the old aux in jack.
- There's a personnel issue at work, but it has a bright side and is totally surmountable. It is very likely that the parties involved will grow as a result. That's not an easy way to get growth, but I'll take it, this time.
- I hit a new one-rep deadlift max on Wednesday. 365lbs is a far cry from the max of my youth or even of a decade ago, but I can see my way to exceeding those with time. Forward!
