<summary>I had an interesting conversation about religion, with Claude of all things. This post is a departure from my usual content – a lengthy conversation about religion, with an AI chatbot, and deeply personal.</summary>

**Jon**: Am I an atheist, or irreligious, or something else? Talk me through it so I can figure out how I actually relate to religion.

> **Claude**: Happy to help you work through this — these terms get used interchangeably a lot but they actually carve things up differently. Let me ask a few questions to get a sense of where you're starting from. Take your time with these — there's no right answer, and the goal is just to get an honest snapshot of where you actually are.

I do not practice, and in the past when I had attempted even the most basic vanilla ICC christian practice it felt wrong to me. So not pursuing a religion is a facet of my identity, but not a critical one.

> That's really useful context. The "felt wrong" part is particularly interesting — that's worth unpacking a bit, because it could mean a few different things. These two together will tell me a lot — the first gets at your relationship to belief, the second at your underlying metaphysics.

It's all explicable through nature and science, but the horizon of knowledge recedes away from us faster than we move toward it, and this existence is so dang improbably and special-feeling that one does have a sense of awe and wonder that cannot be denied.

> That's a beautifully precise description, and it actually maps onto some well-established intellectual territory. Let me reflect it back to you.
>
> On the belief side, you're clearly a **naturalist** — you hold that the physical universe is all there is, and that science is the right tool for understanding it. That puts you in atheist territory in the strict sense (no gods or supernatural agents), though "atheist" as a label often carries cultural baggage — the combative, religion-is-stupid connotation — that doesn't seem to fit you at all.
>
> What's really interesting is the second part. The awe you're describing isn't a soft concession to religion — it's actually a well-recognized philosophical position sometimes called **religious naturalism** or **secular spirituality**. The idea is that the natural world itself, properly contemplated, generates the same emotional and existential responses that religion tries to capture: wonder, humility, a sense of something vast and beyond us. Carl Sagan was probably its most famous voice. Einstein talked about it too, calling it a "cosmic religious feeling" — which confused a lot of people into thinking he believed in God, when he really meant something much closer to what you just described.
>
> The "horizon receding faster than we approach it" framing is particularly sharp. That's not just poetic — it's an epistemically humble position that separates you from the more dogmatic varieties of atheism, which can sometimes have their own kind of overconfidence.
>
> So here's how I'd tentatively characterize you: you're a **naturalistic atheist with genuine existential wonder** — someone who doesn't need the supernatural to feel the weight and strangeness of existence. "Irreligious" doesn't quite capture you, because that word implies indifference, and you're clearly not indifferent. You just locate the awe differently than religion does.
>
> Does that resonate? And I'm still curious — what was it that felt wrong about the Christian practice specifically? That might add another layer to the picture.

That's a GIGANTIC question, what felt wrong exactly. Can we break it up into parts? It'll be easier to talk through in smaller segments.

> Absolutely, let's take it piece by piece. A good place to start is just narrowing down which dimension of it felt most off to you. This will help us figure out which thread to pull on first. Q: Which of these dimensions of Christian practice do you think felt most wrong to you? Rank them — most troubling at the top.

Ranked:

1. The beliefs themselves (God, salvation, miracles, scripture)
2. The practices and rituals (prayer, worship, church attendance)
3. The ethics and moral framework it prescribes
4. The social/community dynamics (belonging, conformity, group identity)

> Good, that's a clear hierarchy. The beliefs being at the top is significant — it means the discomfort isn't primarily social or aesthetic, it goes deeper. It's not that church felt awkward or the people were off-putting; the foundation itself didn't hold for you.
>
> Let's start there then, with the beliefs. Christian belief is actually a bundle of quite different claims, and people often find some parts more problematic than others.These are actually quite separable philosophically — someone can reject miracles but be open to a deistic God, for instance, so your ranking here will tell us a lot about where the real friction is. Q: Within the beliefs themselves, which bothered you most? Rank these.

Ranked:

1. The exclusivity claim (Christianity as the one true path)
2. Scripture as divinely inspired or authoritative
3. The salvation framework (sin, redemption, heaven/hell)
4. The existence of a personal God who intervenes in the world
5. Miracles and supernatural events (resurrection, virgin birth, etc.)

> This is a really revealing ranking — and honestly a somewhat surprising one. Most naturalists lead with miracles or the personal God as their primary objection, since those are the most direct conflicts with a scientific worldview. But you've put those at the bottom. That tells me something important: your deepest friction with Christianity isn't really metaphysical, it's **ethical and epistemological**.
>
> Think about what the top two actually share. The exclusivity claim says: "we have the one truth, and everyone else is wrong or damned." Scripture as authoritative says: "this particular text has a privileged, unquestionable status." Both are fundamentally claims about **who gets to know things, and how**. That's a very different kind of objection than "I don't believe in miracles."
>
> It suggests your core resistance is to the **certainty and exclusivity** of the package — the way it closes off inquiry and implicitly diminishes every other human attempt to grapple with existence. Given your earlier framing about the horizon of knowledge always receding, that makes deep sense. A worldview that claims to have final answers would feel suffocating to someone who finds meaning in the **open-endedness** of the questions.
>
> The salvation framework being third is interesting too — that's partly a fairness objection (why should the circumstances of your birth determine your eternal fate?) and partly a discomfort with the whole architecture of guilt and rescue.
>
> And the personal intervening God and miracles being least bothersome? That's actually quite philosophically interesting. It might mean you're not primarily a God-denier — you're a **certainty-denier**. You're less bothered by the **possibility** of something beyond the natural than by anyone claiming confident, exclusive knowledge of what that something is.
>
> Does that land accurately? Because if so, it shifts the label a bit — you might be less "atheist" in the assertive sense, and more something like an **agnostic naturalist with strong epistemic humility**.

To me the exclusivity and infallibility clauses are needlessly exclusionary and deeply anti-intellectual, more so than belief in miracles woudl be. Remembering that there is more we don't know than we do, it is possible that today's "miracle" will be scientifically explained tomorrow. Also, some of the scriptural miracles, such as the "loaves and fishes" story, can be seen as moral parables rather than miracles *per se*. So miracles do bother me the least. (I'm also not credulous of them.)

That ethical framework extends to the idea of salvation – that there's a magic formula that anoints you forever more as good or bad is also counter to my thoughts about what it means to live ethically.

There's nowhere else for the personal god thing to go with all of these ethical objections stacked up at the beginning. Something being at or near the bottom doesn't mean I don't object, just that the other objections are greater.

> That clarification sharpens the picture considerably, and it all hangs together with real internal logic.
>
> What you're describing is essentially a **coherent ethical and epistemological worldview** that Christianity (in its orthodox forms) violates at multiple levels. Let me trace the thread:
>
> You hold that knowledge is always provisional — the horizon recedes. From that premise, any system that declares itself the final, infallible authority on truth is automatically suspect. That's not just a religious objection, it's a fundamental intellectual stance. Exclusivity and scriptural infallibility offend it most directly. Miracles offend it least because you can accommodate them within a humble framework — "we don't fully understand this yet" is a perfectly coherent position that doesn't require credulity.
>
> The salvation point is particularly sharp. What you're rejecting there is the idea of **ethics as a status rather than a practice**. A magic formula that stamps you saved or damned treats moral life as a one-time transaction rather than something you actually have to live, day by day, with all its difficulty and revision and failure and growth. That's a serious philosophical objection — it's essentially the same critique Aristotle made of rule-based ethics, and that existentialists like Sartre made of any system that lets you outsource moral responsibility.
>
> And yes — once you've stacked up "closed epistemology," "exclusivity," "static moral formula," and "infallible text," a personal intervening God almost doesn't need a separate objection. It's already implicated in everything above.
>
> So here's where I think you actually land: you're a **secular humanist with naturalist commitments and strong epistemic humility**. That's a more precise and honest label than just "atheist" or "irreligious." It captures that your position isn't primarily against religion — it's for something: open inquiry, provisional knowledge, ethics as a living practice, and wonder that doesn't require certainty.
>
> Shall we move on to the practices and rituals layer next — why prayer and worship specifically felt wrong?

Worship in particular gives me the ick – who or what is worthy of worship? I expect that no one is, and especially not a someone that can't be identified. I've been infatuated with people, but did I ever worship one? No.

Prayer is an interesting one; meditation, consideration, background processing, otherwise managing one's mental state is a valuable pursuit and can have real effects on health, outlook, gratitude, etc. Some sects may include these practices under the umbrella of prayer. The "Lord's Prayer" is for me a recitation of reminders on how to live or think about others, for the most part, and I can appreciate that reminder of a useful ethical framework. But I can't, with any feeling of credulity, speak to someone who is not there and does not respond, praise and worship them, plead with them for benefits, etc.

> This is a really precise and honest distinction, and it reveals something interesting about **where** exactly the line is for you.
>
> On worship — your objection isn't just "I don't believe in God." It's almost more fundamental than that: worship itself strikes you as a problematic stance to take toward **anything**. It implies a kind of total subordination that you find hard to justify even toward people you've loved intensely. That's actually a strong philosophical position — some thinkers would call it a commitment to **human dignity and intellectual sovereignty**. You won't prostrate yourself before something you can't verify, examine, or hold accountable. There's something almost Kantian about it — treating yourself as an end, not merely a means, and refusing to diminish that by directing unconditional reverence at an undefined something.
>
> On prayer — you've done something quite sophisticated here without necessarily framing it that way. You've **disaggregated the practice from the theology**. The contemplative, reflective, gratitude-orienting function of prayer? You can see the value clearly. The Lord's Prayer as an ethical checklist? You can appreciate that framing. But the **address** — the "dear God, are you there, it's me" part — breaks down for you at the point of credulity. You can't perform sincerity you don't feel, and speaking earnestly to someone you don't believe is listening would be a kind of self-deception. Which loops back to your core — intellectual honesty is non-negotiable for you.
>
> What this suggests is that you're not allergic to the functions religion serves. Reflection, ethical reminders, awe, community, meaning-making — you can see the value in all of those. What you can't do is route them through a supernatural address that requires you to pretend. That's a very coherent position, and it actually has a name: **religious functionalism without supernaturalism**. You want what religion does without the metaphysical claims it insists you accept to get there.
>
> Shall we look at the ethics layer next — what specifically in the Christian moral framework chafed?

We've been through the ethical objections in this conversation already, and my brief dalliance with the Congregational church (ICC) lacked some of these problems. For example, the infallibility of scripture, the exclusivity of the path, the idea of being chosen or redeemed or saved; all were not prominent features of the church I attended. But they are prominent features in some measure of many religious practices. It's unethical to exclude, it's anti-intellectual to blindly believe, ethics are a practice, etc. Moral parables, some in the guise of miracles, are valuable for teaching ethics, and it's not necessary to read much more into these stories than that; they can function perfectly well without the insistence that they are literal expressions of history.

> You're right, and that's actually a really important clarification that reframes things somewhat. Let me synthesize what it adds.
>
> Your objections were never really to **religion as such** — they're to specific features that appear with varying intensity across different traditions. The Congregational experience being more tolerable makes sense precisely because it had dialed down the things you find most objectionable: the exclusivity, the infallibility, the salvation transaction. Strip those out, and what you're left with is a community gathering around ethical reflection, moral stories, contemplative practice, and shared meaning — and you can see the value in that.
>
> What this tells me is that your position is more **discriminating** than a flat rejection of religion. You're not anti-religion the way someone who finds the whole enterprise absurd would be. You're opposed to specific intellectual and ethical vices that often travel with religion but aren't intrinsic to it. Blind certainty, exclusion, moral outsourcing — these bother you wherever they appear, in religion or elsewhere. Religion just happens to be a particularly prominent carrier of them.
>
> So pulling the whole conversation together, here's a portrait of where you actually are:
>
> You're a **secular humanist and naturalist** who holds knowledge as always provisional, ethics as a living practice rather than a granted status, and wonder as something the natural world generates abundantly without supernatural assistance. You're not hostile to religion's functions — community, ethical reflection, moral storytelling, contemplation — just unwilling to accept the metaphysical and epistemological price tags that orthodox forms insist on charging. And that price feels to you not just personally unconvincing but genuinely **unethical**.
>
> "Irreligious" undersells it. "Atheist" misdirects it. **Secular humanist** is probably the most honest single label — but really the description is richer than any label.

Thank you for the discussion. I will ponder it.

> It was a genuinely interesting conversation to work through with you. You came in with a question and turned out to have a remarkably coherent and well-examined position already — the discussion just helped surface what was already there.
>
> Good pondering.
