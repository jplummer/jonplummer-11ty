So many things, in retrospect:

- Home progress!
  - Landscaping is done, trees are in
  - Storm drains are cleaned
  - The network is regularly providing 1200Mbps, after modernizing a bit (paid for by selling the slightly older equipment)
- Work progress!
  - The concept sprint I led was a resounding success – the execs wish they could sell our plan now, but they recognize they need to wait until they fund it and we build it – and there's talk of more
  - The pendulum is swinging back toward being more customer-centric
- Life progress!
  - I pulled 410 last week by doing the plate math wrong, and it was no problem at all
  - At my last appointment my PT said "good job;" I bet PTs don't say that often
