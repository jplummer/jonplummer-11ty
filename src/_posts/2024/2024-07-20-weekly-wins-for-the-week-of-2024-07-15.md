- Vacations are winding down and people are starting to come back to work. The team is filling out again.
- I convinced the SVP of Product to be quizzed about our product strategy – we'll put a script and some visuals together for our annual Company Connect and hopefully address longstanding complaints that people aren't sure how their work contributes to our strategy. This has raised other interesting topics that might also become topics, like how we really make money and where it goes, how our pricing and packaging works, etc. A lot of the things I was hoping to accomplish this year have been deprioritized (rightly) due to some technical pickles we find ourselves in, so this represents an opportunity to be influential beyond the usual process sand product stuff we do on the reg; fingers crossed.
- The ladies are back and the house is no longer empty. This also means my diet will improve – bachelor-mode Jon is (far) less disciplined than husband-mode Jon.
