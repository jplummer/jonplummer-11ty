Work was…fine…this week. Lots of folks are out or about to be out and while there's a moment to try to wrestle projects and processes into shape there are not a lot of people to do that with; preparing projects to to bowl along while they are out is more pressing. But with the girl and the lady out of the house I was productive with home projects. In the last week I've:

- sent a care package
- taken care of a library fine by finding and returning the book
- bought a copy of that same book, as a gift
- set up garage shelves and populated them
- moved the last of the boxes and tools from the neighbors' garage
- set up a greenhouse (shh, it's a surprise)
- reconnected with an old friend
- thrilled a nephew with birthday gifts
- installed missing trim on a piece of furniture
- installed a door stop on the door to the cat litter box area
- went to a baseball game
- had the tires replaced on a car that sorely needed it
- replaced wipers on that same car
- replaced antenna garnish on that same car
- washed a different car
- given myself a haircut
- put a hook on the back of the closet door
- built a credible trashcan of an unusual size for a specific installation
- found and replaced a furnace filter
- epoxied together the house numbers and their holding shape
- done some emergency laundry
- kept all the plants and cats alive
