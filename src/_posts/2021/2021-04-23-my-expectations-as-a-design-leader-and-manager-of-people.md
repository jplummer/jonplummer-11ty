## Expectations of myself

- Foster an ethos of continuous improvement
- Repeatedly return to user needs and goals to create alignment
- Frame design goals as the marriage of user goals and business wishes
- Exhibit genuine care for each person I support
- Use wisdom and humor when shaping behavior
- Model desired behavior and attitudes for others
- Address what's needed wherever it appears

## Expectations of designers

- Scenario-based, goal-oriented
- Use storyboards to start understanding a scenario
- Freely move between storyboard, workflow, wires, prototype as needed to tackle problems
- Make small prototypes to test and learn
- The prioritization and arrangement of data directs user attention and action
- Organize "done" work into bite-size chunks, set apart from exploratory work

## Expectations of all workers

- Work to make the job of the next person easier
- Work in public, out in the open
- Go and see
- Be aware of and have your work informed by user goals and business needs together
- Create possibilities cheaply, winnow according to goals, improve the best ones
- Involve others in solving problems, chewing on possibilities
- When presenting possibilities, arrive with your own evaluation of each one – pros and cons, fit to purpose, what you like and don’t like – and the sort of feedback you need
- Scope is negotiated – watch for improvements AND for lighter interventions
- Experiment with possible improvements to your own and collective work
