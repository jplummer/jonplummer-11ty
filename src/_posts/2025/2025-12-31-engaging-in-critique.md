description: Topics you might bring up in critique are the same as you might investigate when starting a project. The rest come from hearing about the work.

A designer recently pointed out that they were quiet in critique because they weren't sure what to talk about or how to engage with the material being presented. They noted that several others always seem to have something useful or interesting to say in critique, and asked for ways to be helpful.

The good news is that the presenter should give you some good raw material to work with. At the beginning of their presentation they should quickly mention

* where they are in the project
* the design goals for the work, and other relevant goals
* what they are thinking about
* what sort of feedback would be most helpful

and these provide fine starting points with which to engage the work.

Then there is your experience of the work as presented.

* Does this make sense to me?
  * Does this conform with my understanding of the system?
  * Would I understand this as a lay person?
    * How much specialized knowledge do I need to have to make use of this?
    * Does this use words and concepts I am already familiar with?
    * Does this ask questions I am prepared to answer?
* Does the design seem likely to be familiar/usable/intuitive/operable?
  * How standard is the usage of the interface elements, patterns, or design system components used in the design?
  * Does this introduce new interactions where familiar ones would do?
  * Is it clear what I would get from operating each control?
* Does this seem like a complete experience, or a fragment?
  * Does this narrow slice fit well where it is intended to fit?
  * Does it have a beginning, middle, and end? Does my work as a user pay off?
  * Are there other experiences that it might depend on or contribute to?
    * What would it take to coordinate this experience with those others?

And, of course, you can zoom out a bit. This can require a delicate touch depending on the sort of feedback desired and how late we are in the project.

* How well does the design address the goals the presenter offers?
  * Are the presenter's goals or project goals clear? Sensible? Customer-centered?
* Is the customer value clear?
  * Is the path to that value straightforward?
  * Is that value demonstrated by the new capability?
* Is the design or workflow well-explained? Is it going to be intelligible to team members?
* How does this relate to my projects or service areas?
  * Do I recognize anything from my current or past projects that is relevant/useful here?
  * Do I recognize work or difficulties for other teams in this projects?
  * Are there knowledgeable people that could help with this project that I can introduce?
