Conversational design has become an important topic of late, and at work we've been chewing on this for a few different conversation channels and purposes. Familiar old principles from consumer electronics setup and other experiences are coming up anew, such as

- **Don't ask if you don't have to.** Detect and test, detect and confirm, infer and confirm, offer the most common option, and only if forced just ask without offering.
- **Only ask questions the user is prepared to answer.** There's little point in asking if you won't get a confident answer; find another way to learn the needed information.
- **Stay away from inviting yes/no answers.** It speeds the conversation along to offer a choice, A or B, rather than merely asking if A is acceptable. Avoiding the yes/no answer gets us to a conclusion more quickly and feels proactive. If need be you can offer a complete option A and *suggest* you have other options; the choice is logically equivalent to yes/no but feels better.
- **Offer options that are complete.** Insofar as possible, offering an option that is complete allows the user to select quickly and get to the happy conclusion; breaking a decision up into many parts feels slow and cumbersome, programmatic and unnatural. "I have Il Fornaio at 7:30pm on Thursday, does that sound good" is a nicer thing to assent to than separately negotiating which restaurant, what day, what time only to be faced with "sorry, I don't have that time. What other time?"
- **Offer nearby alternatives.** In the restaurant example, when the user's preference can't be met, rather than negotiate the whole thing again, offer nearby options. "I don't have Il Fornaio at 7:30pm, but there's a table at 8:30pm. Would you prefer that, or would you like me to look for another restaurant at 7:30pm?" is a question I'd much rather answer than "Il Fornaio is not available at 7:30pm. Available times are 4:00pm, 4:30pm, 5:00pm, 8:30pm, 8:45pm, 9:15pm. Which would you prefer?" The underlying business may know what their customers would prefer, which variables are more important, so…
- **Understand user feelings about multivariate choices.** Is it more important to see the doctor you usually see, or to have an appointment at the time you prefer? Is it more important to go to the tire shop you usually go to, or do you need the flat fixed right away? Etc.
