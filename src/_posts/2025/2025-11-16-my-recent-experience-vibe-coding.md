description: "Moving this blog from WordPress to Eleventy has been my first meaningful experiment with AI-assisted coding. And what little development experience I have actually had has come in very handy."

This blog has gone through a lot of generations – once a portfolio site, then a self-hosted WordPress blog ([boo](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/22/tumblr-ceo-publicly-spars-with-trans-user-over-account-ban-revealing-private-account-names-in-the-process/), [Matt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP_Engine#WordPress_dispute_and_lawsuit)!), later a static site backed by local WordPress as a CMS, and now an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev)-based generated static site.

I initially tried to make Eleventy work on my own, but the software development landscape has changed so much from when I dabbled in it professionally in the early 1990s (I've designed the whole time, but haven't done any implementation in an age) that even getting my bearings was a rocky start. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com), [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), [Liquid](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/intro-to-liquid.html), [YAML](https://yaml.org), [Git](https://git-scm.com), all are new since then. None of these is terribly complicated, but shake them all up in a bag and you can be left wondering what's working, what's broken, where to put things, and where to look. Heck, the notion of [server-side JavaScript](https://nodejs.carlosrojas.dev/understanding-javascript-on-the-server-side-fad714206f14) was fairly new when I turned my focus to design leadership. [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) was just becoming popular at that time, we had just started dabbling in [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org) rather than [Subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion), and [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) was something you read about on [Douglas Crockford's site](https://www.crockford.com/about.html).

So I turned to [Cursor](https://cursor.com). Critically, the first thing I asked it to talk through with me was a plan to take my WordPress site export, stand up an 11ty project locally, and migrate all of the content. I then beefed up that plan with all of the ideas I had about keeping things on GitHub, improving the local site, deploying it to my shared host, improving the typography, improving meta tags, etc. And, again critically, I asked for help grouping those wishes and ideas into sensible chunks and prioritizing them. I didn't always agree with the recommendations, but having a plan and thus being able to work it in priority order (any sort of order, really) prevents scattered and incomplete efforts.

It was also important to have Cursor not just race off and do things on its own, but talk through them first and prefer small interventions rather than large ones. This has led to bringing 11ty docs into the project for context, a lengthy `.cursorrules` that attempts to explain that Cursor should not go on at length about how I'm "absolutely right" and should prefer forming a plan and asking me about it, etc. Even so, Cursor will do some strange things like reimplementing existing date functions and whatnot; my little bit of development experience has been helpful to detect odd smells in what Cursor says it is doing and quiz it about whether these things are strictly necessary, noticing duplicate development, recognizing parts of the project that might need updating in response to a change elsewhere and asking about it, etc.

Third, as with one's own work it has been important to check Cursor's results, and since a static site generator can produce a lot of files, automated and manual testing are both necessary. Happily, Cursor can form a plan, discuss, and implement test scripts, and I've got quite a few of these now, even importing [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) for some basic accessibility checking of the resulting HTML. I can now run tests on accessibility, content structure, external and internal links, HTML validation, the validity of my RSS feeds, the correctness of my meta tags and other basic SEO concerns, even likely site performance (which in a static site is mainly about file size).

Cursor has also been a big help with documentation. I started with just a `plan.md`; now I have that pulled-in 11ty documentation and a script to refresh it, a `commands.md` that reminds me what all the different build, test, and deployment commands do, a `notes.md` that reminds me how my article frontmatter works, what I've been thinking about re color schemes, and how to make a redirect. There's no sense trying to remember things that you can write down, and Cursor can help with that too. "Cursor, now that we've made these changes is there anything that needs to change in `plan.md`?"

While using Cursor doesn't magically make me a competent developer, it has allowed me to make much more progress in a handful of weekends than I was doing on my own, and feel more confident in the result (mainly because of all the things I've had to correct Cursor on). And it's fabulous to watch my progress through my plan.md. I'm getting down to the parts of the plan that I was putting off, which is a good sign.

Now I'm inspired to tackle other projects I've wished for, like a [plain English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_English) service for MacOS that helps you find alternatives for the least common words in a selected bit of text. Who knows if that's the right way to do it, but I can give it a try and see if I like it rather than wondering.

A little bit of what I've done for this site, and in what order, can be read in the [changelog](/changelog/) (generated from Git commits), if you're into that sort of thing. There's also a generated list of [technologies](/technologies/).
