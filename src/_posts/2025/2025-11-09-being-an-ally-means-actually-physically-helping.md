I realized something a little while ago: for me, being an ally means actually physically helping.

I had long thought about allyship in terms of support, advocacy, speaking up, and sharing privilege – practically a checklist of things we are reminded to do in being an ally. But I never really felt that I was effective in doing these things. How exactly does one share privilege?

I've found that unless I put myself in places where I can exercise those things, occasions don't arise to employ them. That means that if I want to actually be active in being an ally, I've got to go to a place and physically help. Be a member of Rainbow Guard for Pride. Be a de-escalator at a protest or a cultural festival. Be on the safety/lookout team for a local ethnic group. Print whistles for community shaming of ICE and CPB. Ferry food donations to a distribution center to help people through the SNAP gap. Etc.

By giving my presence and labor, I can be helpful, demonstrate esteem for the people or cause at hand, and use my position as a cis het white guy, the least vulnerable among us, to actually be an ally, not just think nice thoughts.
