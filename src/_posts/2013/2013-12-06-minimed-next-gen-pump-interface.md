Medtronic engaged IDEO to help design a next-generation pump to succeed the MiniMed 522, which combined insulin delivery with wireless continuous glucose measurement. IDEO proposed a more capable LCD screen and more buttons, among other things. Before the project was shelved in favor of a patch-pump concept I took over interaction design from IDEO.

  <figcaption>A bolus (one-time insulin dose) status screen showing the last dose of insulin and approximately how much has been metabolized, along with the basal infusion rate. Such a view did not exist on pumps of the day, and patients longed for a way to know how much of the meal-related or correction bolus they had taken was still available in their bloodstream to continue lowering their blood sugar.</figcaption>

My role: ideation, workflows, on-screen and physical mockups, usability testing, demonstrating enhanced usability to executives and the firmware and pump hardware teams

Lessons learned: it's easy to be a bad client and fail to get your money's worth from even the most capable firm. Industrial design and interaction design should be done at the same time so they can inform each other; no team, however excellent, can make a perfect pure vessel for another to fill.
