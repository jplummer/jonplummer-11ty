While working on the identity and without any experience marketing a business, I proposed and was given the greenlight to redesign the Mann Consulting website. A relatively clean and sparse site was the result, with a handful of randomly selected "single-sell" main graphics, a proto-blog, and a small number of tightly-focused pages, all aimed at explaining the benefit and encouraging a phone call.

The winning design and identity:

My role: pitch, concepts, visual design, HTML and graphics production

Some other possibilities, with a provisional identity:
