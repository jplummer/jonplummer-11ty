Identity package for Mann Consulting, a small IT consultancy in San Francisco focused on advertising and graphic design firms. Many venues were explored, but I kept coming back to the cube. Nearly two decades on they are still quite happy with it.

My role: ideation and development of the mark and logotype, application to business cards, tee and polo shirts, letterhead, brochures, and the website, production of print-ready artwork, outsourcing of offset printing, screen printing, and embroidery

Exploratory work:
