In early October I was asked to give an eight-to-ten-minute presentation summing up the year for UX. A tall order, but I embraced blazing through the content to alight briefly on things I though the general company audience should know about UX and how we were trying to help.

With most of our work going toward rewrites that had not yet launched there was little to say about outcomes, so I followed a rapid tour of our outputs with a couple of quick demos and an invitation to view my upcoming Cayuse Connect Conference talk about [UX philosophy and practice](https://jonplummer.com/2022/11/01/conference-talk-ux-philosophy/).

*Page 1: I’m Jon Plummer, I’m the director of user experience, I use he/him pronouns, and I’m here to show you a little bit about what the UX team has been up to. I’m going to race through this. My habit of NOT reading the slides should help.*

*Page 2: The UX team charter holds that our job is to help understand the needs of our customers and users; improve intelligibility, usefulness, usability, and inclusiveness of our products; and to investigate and offer conceptual designs for new needs. Of course these are not solely the UX team’s responsibility; we must work in concert with product management and engineering to accomplish anything. And we’ve done a lot of that over the last year or so.*

*Page 3: In order to make what the charter asks for possible we’ve made a design system and put in place a strategy to recruit research participants. The design system in particular is interesting because it speeds up and makes more consisted the delivery of designs, should help speed up and make more consistent the engineering of those designs, and is a key tool in our fight to continuously improve accessibility.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 4](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-4.png)
*Page 4: In order to make what the charter asks for possible we’ve effected a bunch of other process changes, in whole or in part. I won’t read all of these as there’s not time, but they have in general to do with incoming user data, measurement, accessibility, design quality, or team decision-making quality.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 5](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-5.png)
*Page 5: In order to make what the charter asks for possible we’ve done some training. Again, I won’t read them.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 6](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-6.png)
*Page 6: In order to make what the charter asks for possible Emily has delivered a LOT of documentation.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 7](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-7.png)
*Page 7: And of course, we’ve produced a lot of designs. But I can hear the executives saying “these lists are all outputs!”*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 8](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-8.png)
*Page 8: What about outcomes? Show, don’t tell. Okay, here are three quick examples.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 9](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-9.png)
*Page 9: Inventions already had invoices, and people could preview them and download them but needed a way to send them without having to wrestle with the system to get the invoice out, get supporting documents out, attach them using a separate email program, write up a message, get it addressed to the right people, etc. Since Inventions already knows who is associated with your technology, who is associated with your agreement, who is in your department, this could be made much easier. This little link right here hides a lot of power.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 10](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-10.png)
*Page 10: We’ve designed a familiar email interface, recognizable without training…*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 11](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-11.png)
*Page 11: …that already has the invoice attached to it and allows you to select related docs, already listed here for your convenience. It’s fairly obvious how to use it because it is reminiscent of other email interfaces that people already use day in and day out.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 12](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-12.png)
*Page 12: The template feature allows you to establish the desired recipients by role, making it possible to send an invoice to the right people very quickly.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 13](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-13.png)
*Page 13: It also allows you to put useful data in the subject line, and write a message right into the template. Once you’ve selected a template to use, the most you might need to do is personalize the body of the message a bit. But using the familiar email interface you can adjust whatever you need Research activities that made this design possible include user interviews and CAB meetings. Designs were shared with CAB members for validation as we went.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 14](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-14.png)
*Page 14: Here’s another one. Admins in SP need to share information with each other without inadvertently sharing it with others on the project. They need to review the work of others and have guidance to do so, and they need to share notes and attachments with other admins separately from the notes others are sharing on a given project or proposal. With the help of CAB members we investigated these needs and settled on an interface that…*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 15](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-15.png)
*Page 15: …simply augmented the existing UI depending on role. For convenience,…*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 16](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-16.png)
*Page 16: …admin-only notes and attachments appear together in their own tab, which has the happy side-effect of allowing the admins to leave explanatory comments about the attachments themselves. It also alleviates confusion about what is visible or not visible to non-admins. Relatively tight iteration of designs with individual CAB members made this nearly a co-design exercise.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 17](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-17.png)
*Page 17: Here’s one that’s not complete yet, but you can see the difference in convenience between what was and what will be pretty clearly. In Inventions one needs to take incoming money and distribute it to various parties according to the terms of technology licensing agreement. So at some point someone in the tech transfer office has to make a distribution template that will do all the math for them. This involves setting up rules and, within some of those rules, additional rules to determine to what people or departments or organizations money will be sent. One challenge with the existing interface is that whenever you add something to the template it gets added at the bottom, and there’s a lot of clicking on these icons on the side to bring it to the right place. You have to figure out where to put it, what level to indent it, etc. It’s highly manual and there’s so many clicks just to position things correctly. It’s easy to make mistakes, only to have the system complain at you that you did it wrong. And it’s not that easy to follow what is nested where.Work of the designer and PM directly with some key customer users made this design possible.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 18](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-18.png)
*Page 18: So let’s let you add an item where it should go on the template rather than just at the bottom. we’ll make things only go where the nesting can be correct.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 19](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-19.png)
*Page 19: And let’s guide your action through labeling and clear nesting. This results in a less flexible interface, but one that is less prone to error, as we’ve lopped off a raft of opportunities for mistakes. The nesting is clearer. We can let you move things around, but you can’t put them in patently wrong places. And it takes much fewer operations, fewer clicks and drags, to make these changes. Also, we can pull in things the system already knows and not make you re-enter them. When it comes time to use one of these templates we can pull in the people and groups that are already established in the system. The job of data entry becomes merely looking it over to see that it’s right. We’re also considering looking at the most common distribution templates our customers need and seeing if we can ship with some of these as templates already built, further reducing the work it takes to get started. Rather than making something from scratch you can start with something close to right, and bend it to your needs. Work of the designer and PM directly with some key customer users made this design possible.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 20](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-20.png)
*Page 20: Every presentation needs a little bit of the future in it; so what’s next?*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 21](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-21.png)
*Page 21: A while ago I mentioned these three horizons in which the design and product management teams needed to work, (you can think of these horizons as UNDERSTAND, CONCEPT, DETAIL) and pointed out that so much of our work is tactical, stuck in H1 and I wanted to get into the other horizons. We’ve been doing that, but there’s more to do to really capture value here.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 22](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-22.png)
*Page 22: H3 makes H2 possible, and to do better in H3 we need to pay more attention to incoming user data, do better at measuring experience success, and have even more direct contact with users.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 23](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-23.png)
*Page 23: That’ll make it possible to actually do conceptual design so that we can have engineering, customer, and user help choosing among different possible solutions.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 24](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-24.png)
*Page 24: That in turn will make it possible to further raise the quality and fitness of the experiences we ship. We’ll also need to do more usability testing to make sure initial quality is high.*

![quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05 page 25](/assets/images/2022/10/quick-ux-accomplishments-2022-10-05-page-25.png)
*Page 25: Thanks for humoring me racing through this, and if you want a touch more depth I welcome you to come to my talk at Connect on the first day.*
