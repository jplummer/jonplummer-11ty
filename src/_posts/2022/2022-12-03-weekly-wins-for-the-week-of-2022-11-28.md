- I accepted the offer and will start December 12. Startup paperwork was mostly easy, save for finding the exact dates of move in/out and start/stop for my address and work histories. Getting a local notary to do my I-9 right took a couple of tries, but it is done, supposedly.
- Christmas gifts are almost entirely sewn up. Everything I don't already have in-hand is at least ordered and on the way.
- I brought a little bit of interview prep here as an article. It was easy. And since similar articles are an important part of my portfolio in that they are demonstrations of what I bring to a team, I feel I should figure out how to usefully mingle these with more traditional portfolio items. That could take a lot of forms, but I'll turn my advice on myself and
    - Name the problem specifically
    - Identify the audiences and what I need them to see or learn
    - Come up with several concepts to address that problem, for those audiences
    - Select one concept according to its fitness AND feasibility
    - _Only then_ execute that concept, progressively
