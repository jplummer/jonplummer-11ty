- I blasted through a workout centered on lunges this weekend. This would have been unthinkable a year ago, or even six months ago.
- In an attempt to be a little more social I had coffee with local friend Joey. It was very nice.
- I'm out of the woods far enough on my coming presentations that my stress level has gone down. Now to practice, polish, and cut.
- My adjustments to "find maintenance" with my food intake have, with the help of nutrition coach Christine Imperato, seemingly been successful: I'm now hovering easily at around 200 pounds and know how to stay there at my current activity level. It's a good place from which to try a cut later, as an experiment. It's a good place from which to try lots of things.
