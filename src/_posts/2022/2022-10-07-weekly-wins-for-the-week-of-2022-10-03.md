- My eight minute talk wherein I tried to explain/demo the accomplishments of my department over the prior year seemed to go fine. Folks in my department liked it, anyhow.
- The gym was closed on Tuesday. No matter – I went for a run. And it was somewhat enjoyable.
- A former coworker sent me a very nice message. It made my week!

> I hope you’re doing well! It’s been quite a while since I last spoke to you, and I wanted to say how much I appreciate the impact you have had on my life. I reap the benefits of it almost daily, and I hope to be like you when I grow up.
