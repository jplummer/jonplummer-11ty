- I involved the team in figuring out how we would rearrange ourselves now that we have new product priorities, and they came up with what I expect is a good solution without any teeth-gnashing at all.
- Conference talk #1 is nearly done, #2 is well-in-hand, and the participatory design exercises are coming along nicely.
- I've graduated to weighted pushups, "wearing" a 45lb plate.
- While a weights workout still leaves me with a sore knee, these bouts are less painful and last less time than in the past. I'm taking it as a sign that I'm pushing hard at workouts and am happy to give myself a little pat on the back for this.
