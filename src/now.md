(Updated {{ date | postDate }}. This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page, and if you have your own site [you might consider making one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.)

I'm currently experimenting with

* AI-powered design tools and working with our existing design system. It's a fragmented space and changing daily, so this is a bit of "surfing the chaos," a posture I don't generally favor
* bringing AI "workflow agent" ideas to the platform
* what's the least effective dose of rebranding/reskinning
* Cursor use as a lapsed coder (I've not really worked with code since the echo of the first dot-com boom, so there's a lot to catch up on), including little projects in
  * Eleventy
  * Vanilla CSS-only accessible menus (sure there are a thousand articles on these, but it's fun to experiment with an understood problem)
  * Theming React pages

The concept sprint went well enough that people want to "codify and democratize" concept sprints. Too soon! But it's a vote of confidence in the process and the value it produces.

I'm also currently trying to create clarity for new OKRs the UX team will be involved in. We've been happy to be indirectly involved in OKRs to this point as it took the pressure off, but I see now that doing so also squandered opportunities to be influential. The pendulum has swung the other way and we'll be working on three of them.
