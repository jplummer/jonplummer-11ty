(Updated {{ date | postDate }}. This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page, and if you have your own site [you might consider making one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.)

About a year ago I picked up a new hobby: 3d printing. As of mid-August you can add AI-assisted software development to the list. With an AI assistant like Cursor the barrier to getting started with a variety of technologies is much lower, so ideas are much closer to becoming reality than before. And I've got plenty of ideas.

Since getting started I've converted this site from WordPress to 11ty, adding scads of tests, authoring helps, and other features; started a MacOS menu bar clock that counts down to your statistical life expectancy (memento mori) or up from your date of birth (memento vivere); started a project to build a site to showcase tee shirt designs; started building an iOS app to fetch a single task from your honeydo list to avoid the paradox of choice; replaced my poersonal file pile site with a somewhat-vibed drop-in file/folder navigator in PHP, written a MacOS service that points out the words you've used in a selected passage of text that aren't in the ten thousand most common english words, and made a book map tool that my wife can edit and export to place on her personal Squarespace site. More to come.

In each of these my long-lapsed front-end web coding experience has been helpful: I have a notion of how a thing could be implemented and I can notice several code smells, but lack facility with the most current frameworks. But a little instruction, a little negotiation, a little correction, and working software is the result.

Both of these hobbies are attractive because they bring design, already fun  and interesting, quickly into reality where you can try it, use it, benefit from it, and improve it. Since this time last year I've designed and printed some 31 personal projects and printed innumerable other pre-designed items.

I've got an idea for an eInk display that fetches the front page of today's newspaper every morning. If I can find a display and a way to drive it this is now a project I can accomplish on my own, as a rank amateur. Interesting and exciting times.

At work I'm also experimenting:

* AI-powered design tools and working with our existing design system. It's a fragmented space and changing daily, so this is a bit of "surfing the chaos," a posture I don't generally favor
* bringing AI "workflow agent" ideas to the Invoca platform
* theming React pages
* some information and data architecture challenges that deserve attention as we move from a technology-led to a more customer-centered product approach

May your winter be ICE-free.
