(Updated {{ date | postDate }}. This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page, and if you have your own site [you might consider making one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.)

About a year ago I picked up a new hobby: 3d printing. As of mid-August you can add AI-assisted software development to the list. With an AI assitant like Cursor the barrier to getting started with a variety of technologies is much lower, so ideas are much closer to becoming reality than before. And I've got plenty of ideas.

Both of these hobbies are attractive because they bring design, already a fun challenge, right into reality where you can try it, use it, benefit from it, and improve it. Since this time last year I've designed and printed some 31 personal projects and printed innumerable other pre-designed items. And since August I've made 194 commits into my own five repositories, including the revamp of this site, a PHP-powered directory listing tool, a MacOS text service to detect the least common words in a passage, a map of Erin's book reviews, and the very early beginnings of a tee shirt design showcase. In each of these my long-lapsed web coding experience has been helpful: I have a notion of how a thing could be implemented and I can notice several code smells, but lack familiarity with the most current tech. But a little instruction, a little negotiation, a little correction, and working software is the result.

I've got an idea for an eInk display that fetches the front page of today's paper every morning. If I can find a display and a way to drive it this is now a project I can accomplish on my own, as a rank amateur. Interesting and exciting times.

At work I'm also experimenting:

* AI-powered design tools and working with our existing design system. It's a fragmented space and changing daily, so this is a bit of "surfing the chaos," a posture I don't generally favor
* bringing AI "workflow agent" ideas to the Invoca platform
* theming React pages
* some information and data architecture challenges that deserve attention as we move from a technology-led to a more customer-centered product approach

I'm also currently trying to create clarity for new OKRs the UX team will be involved in. We've been happy to be indirectly involved in OKRs to this point as it took pressure off, but I see now that doing so also squandered opportunities to be influential. The pendulum has swung the other way and we'll be working on three of them.
