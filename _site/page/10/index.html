        <p>Scattered wins this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>After three tries (all administrative or preparation missteps of one sort or another) the girl now has a learner's permit; a small but crucial step toward learning a few adult skills.</li>
<li>Disconcert between two teams is giving way to eagerness and collaboration. Three things I often talk about are helping us along:
<ol>
<li>referring to real customer data,</li>
<li>finding and negotiating common goals, and</li>
<li>humans remembering to relate to one another.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A couple of the people I support are getting the message that attention to detail must be demonstrated. (In the details! Surprise.) This has required some tight feedback loops, but I think I'm successfully avoiding micromanaging.</li>
<li>Mentorship is fun! I might have a new mentee, perhaps just for the duration of their job search.</li>
</ul>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Group coaching is valuable when the message is positive (&quot;I invite you to do this&quot;) and useful to all and there's no need to single someone out, or when singling someone out would be more pointed than the situation warrants. It allows the saving of face. Small issues such as not having the correct email signature, failing to make a fresh pot of coffee when taking the last cup, etc.</p>
<p>I used group coaching today when I pointed out to my team that, yes, the time slots in our weekly critique are short and it is hard to go deep, but I invite them to pursue feedback in other ways as well (and listed some ways). There were two people who needed that message the most, but it was relevant to all of them.</p>
<p>It's not the same thing as complaining to someone about problematic behavior, or escalating this complaint to their supervisor, which are more inherently pointed or even confronting.</p>
<p>We all wish that people would come directly to us individually for their wishes and corrections, but sometimes they are not sure they should, or don't want to confront, or are nervous about their skills in such an interaction, or don't want to make a big deal of it, or mention it in passing in more established relationships, or…myriad options.</p>
<p>(If you spend too much effort parsing the behavior of others you are likely to do the same for your own behavior, or vice versa, which will make it harder to relax and act in the moment. When I find myself stressed about how someone else's complaint came to me I try to set aside the manner and just focus on the content. Often there's at least a little something right in the complaint.)</p>

<li>I'm mostly eating right anyhow, in contrast with other such times</li>
<li>Chauffeuring to and from ballet and other events has not been a problem (and I have people to help next week)</li>
<li>The girl was interested in seeing Snarky Puppy with me on Tuesday, and it was a good show. No opener, right to the good stuff</li>
<li>Nothing blew up while the one PM director was away, a credit to the team. Yay</li>

        <p>I had a medical…thing…to do on Monday so this was another shortish week, the sort where all the meetings get slid atop one another to occupy available space so you can pretend that it was not a short week. Even so,</p>
<ul>
<li>The medical thing went fine. I remember nothing.</li>
<li>Friday was meeting-light so I got a little bit of non-meeting work done.</li>
<li>I realized that for a handful of the initiatives I'm on I needn't toil in obscurity but would do better to send async questions to a handful of people, so I did.</li>
<li>A team-wide message from the CEO mentioned &quot;The transition to a multi-product company, the importance of AI, and strengthening the role of UX and front end engineering have emerged more clearly for me as priorities.&quot; – It's sinking in!</li>

        <h1><a href="/2023/06/15/someone-mentions-specialized-enterprise-users-in-re-accessibility/" rel="bookmark">Someone mentions &quot;specialized enterprise users&quot; in re accessibility</a></h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>During a discussion of accessibility and the level of attention a company ought to pay to it, someone said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have always worked in complex enterprise software where the user is a specialized individual and not the general public so accessibility has never been stressed or pushed beyond considering the impact of colors and contrast.</p>
<p>I seek only to take down what they said, so I'll not name them here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This position is entirely understandable, and I suspect that most designers working in a B2B environment receive this excuse from their organizations when asking about those organizations' lack of attention to accessibility. Though it is understandable is also wrong-headed; a close reading reveals where.</p>
<h2>&quot;not the general public&quot;</h2>
<p>Note that</p>
<ul>
<li><em>many</em> of the impairments that make poor attention to accessibility a problem are _not_h less prevalent in enterprises than in the general population, and</li>
<li>where there are differences in prevalence (for example, there are far fewer blind people in knowledge work jobs than in the general population) it’s due in part to lack of attention to accessibility in the tools used or the jobs themselves, making it hard for those people to take jobs that rely on those tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, companies discriminate against their employees and potential employees by not providing accessible tools, and companies that provide such tools but ignore accessibility are complicit, perhaps even participatory, in that harmful practice.</p>
<h2>&quot;specialized individual&quot;</h2>
<p>&quot;Specialized&quot; does not mean &quot;without impairment.&quot; Just as it is wrong to assume that an unnamed doctor is a man, it is wrong to assume that a librarian won't have difficulty carrying books or a software developer won't have difficulty typing or reading a screen. But even folks without long-term disabilities may have, situationally or temporarily, impairments where they too would benefit from attention to accessibility and inclusive design. Witness the <a href="https://www.oxfordcc.co.uk/files/inclusive.png">very nice graphic</a> from the <a href="https://inclusive.microsoft.design/">Microsoft Inclusive Design Manual</a> that demonstrates that people may need accommodation for a permanent issue, due to temporary illness or injury, or due to seemingly unrelated life circumstances. Inclusive design helps all of these.</p>
<p>In this case, I'm not sure &quot;specialized&quot; is correct, even; typically, enterprise software is used by normal people with a normal level of specialness. We’re not dealing with thousands and thousands of Top Gun pilots here. The one way in which these users differ reliably from the general population is in <em>domain knowledge</em> relevant to their work, and even that domain knowledge is not evenly distributed. For example, I work with several systems in my job, and my level of expertise in each of them and the domain they operate in varies widely. I’m just not that special or specialized except in re a few of the many tools I use.</p>
<h2>And don't forget</h2>
<p>Many of the interventions we’d entertain to improve accessibility also improve usability for all users. So the sadly common thought that folks with impairments are special cases that require extraordinary effort for little return is also incorrect.</p>
