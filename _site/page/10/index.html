        <p>The lady is out of town, but</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm mostly eating right anyhow, in contrast with other such times</li>
<li>Chauffeuring to and from ballet and other events has not been a problem (and I have people to help next week)</li>
<li>The girl was interested in seeing Snarky Puppy with me on Tuesday, and it was a good show. No opener, right to the good stuff</li>
<li>Nothing blew up while the one PM director was away, a credit to the team. Yay</li>

        <p>I had a medical…thing…to do on Monday so this was another shortish week, the sort where all the meetings get slid atop one another to occupy available space so you can pretend that it was not a short week. Even so,</p>
<ul>
<li>The medical thing went fine. I remember nothing.</li>
<li>Friday was meeting-light so I got a little bit of non-meeting work done.</li>
<li>I realized that for a handful of the initiatives I'm on I needn't toil in obscurity but would do better to send async questions to a handful of people, so I did.</li>
<li>A team-wide message from the CEO mentioned &quot;The transition to a multi-product company, the importance of AI, and strengthening the role of UX and front end engineering have emerged more clearly for me as priorities.&quot; – It's sinking in!</li>

        <h1><a href="/_posts/2023/06/16/someone-mentions-specialized-enterprise-users-in-re-accessibility/" rel="bookmark">Someone mentions &quot;specialized enterprise users&quot; in re accessibility</a></h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>During a discussion of accessibility and the level of attention a company ought to pay to it, someone said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have always worked in complex enterprise software where the user is a specialized individual and not the general public so accessibility has never been stressed or pushed beyond considering the impact of colors and contrast.</p>
<p>I seek only to take down what they said, so I'll not name them here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This position is entirely understandable, and I suspect that most designers working in a B2B environment receive this excuse from their organizations when asking about those organizations' lack of attention to accessibility. Though it is understandable is also wrong-headed; a close reading reveals where.</p>
<h2>&quot;not the general public&quot;</h2>
<p>Note that</p>
<ul>
<li><em>many</em> of the impairments that make poor attention to accessibility a problem are _not_h less prevalent in enterprises than in the general population, and</li>
<li>where there are differences in prevalence (for example, there are far fewer blind people in knowledge work jobs than in the general population) it’s due in part to lack of attention to accessibility in the tools used or the jobs themselves, making it hard for those people to take jobs that rely on those tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, companies discriminate against their employees and potential employees by not providing accessible tools, and companies that provide such tools but ignore accessibility are complicit, perhaps even participatory, in that harmful practice.</p>
<h2>&quot;specialized individual&quot;</h2>
<p>&quot;Specialized&quot; does not mean &quot;without impairment.&quot; Just as it is wrong to assume that an unnamed doctor is a man, it is wrong to assume that a librarian won't have difficulty carrying books or a software developer won't have difficulty typing or reading a screen. But even folks without long-term disabilities may have, situationally or temporarily, impairments where they too would benefit from attention to accessibility and inclusive design. Witness the <a href="https://www.oxfordcc.co.uk/files/inclusive.png">very nice graphic</a> from the <a href="https://inclusive.microsoft.design/">Microsoft Inclusive Design Manual</a> that demonstrates that people may need accommodation for a permanent issue, due to temporary illness or injury, or due to seemingly unrelated life circumstances. Inclusive design helps all of these.</p>
<p>In this case, I'm not sure &quot;specialized&quot; is correct, even; typically, enterprise software is used by normal people with a normal level of specialness. We’re not dealing with thousands and thousands of Top Gun pilots here. The one way in which these users differ reliably from the general population is in <em>domain knowledge</em> relevant to their work, and even that domain knowledge is not evenly distributed. For example, I work with several systems in my job, and my level of expertise in each of them and the domain they operate in varies widely. I’m just not that special or specialized except in re a few of the many tools I use.</p>
<h2>And don't forget</h2>
<p>Many of the interventions we’d entertain to improve accessibility also improve usability for all users. So the sadly common thought that folks with impairments are special cases that require extraordinary effort for little return is also incorrect.</p>

        <p>We heroically snuck up to Seattle by car late at night and then back the following night, thoroughly wearing ourselves out in the process. The traveling was exhausting and not fun, but…</p>
<ul>
<li>…the event itself, a surprise party for my mother’s 80th birthday, was a smashing success, thanks mainly to my sister-in-law, and…</li>
<li>…I spoke well at the party.</li>
<li>Apple announced the 15” version of the M2 MacBook Air I just bought, and it’s about the same price. Return, purchase, new new machine! (That’s why this post is late – the new machine needed to arrive so I could fire up LocalWP and export the site. Yes, you’re looking at a Wordpress-powered site, but just a static export of it, no actual WP running on the server, ‘cause that’d be slow and hackable. One day I’ll replace this canned theme with my own simplified one, maybe.)</li>
<li>A coworker suffering from burnout opened up to me and I was able to help somewhat.</li>
<li>Another coworker, this one skeptical of my department, brought me a project. We were able to quickly negotiate the scope and I have it in the hands of a capable designer who I’m sure will do a good job without gilding it or underdelivering out of an excess of hurry. I love it when a plan comes together.</li>
<li>My chats about quality are starting to resonate, here and there. Plenty more to do, but it’s maybe sinking in.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Memorial Day made for a short week. Some folks can do about four day's effort in four days, others (managers especially) try to do all the things and pack five days of meetings into the four days, resulting in less space to get other things done, then wonder why they are un happy with the week's results.</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn't do that, this time. I did many of the meetings, but skipped some in favor of actually making stuff. Highly recommended.</li>
<li>Huaraches for men for summer. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1286290385/brown-leather-shoes-for-men-made-in?ref=yr_purchases">They're fab</a>.</li>
<li>I went for a 400lb deadlift and didn't get it, so 375 max. That's fine…for now.</li>
<li>We heard of a problem we inadvertently introduced, proposed a fix, investigated the effect of the fix, and deployed the fix in the same day. That's definitely a step forward in customer-centricity.</li>
</ul>
