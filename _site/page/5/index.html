<p>I'm trying to coach some designers along the path of feeling comfortable adjusting and evolving approaches that have been learned in school (vs believing that there is a single &quot;right&quot; way and that design quality is aligned to how closely they execute against that &quot;textbook&quot; approach). I'd like to be able to share something with them that demonstrates that the higher one's design maturity, the more comfortable/ confident one is with adjusting approaches and trying new things based on context and experience... and that this is a good thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't have a framework or model to point to, but the thing that strikes me as interesting about this question is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>design quality is aligned to how closely they execute against that &quot;textbook&quot; approach</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might be worth pointing out that this is an inward-looking, appeal-to-authority view of quality, measured in the wrong place. Design quality is actually measured by the attainment of user ease and satisfaction coupled with business results, and these do not depend on method adherence. The methods exist to help you get the information you need to achieve these results but they do not deliver these results themselves.</p>

        <p>A grab bag:</p>
<ul>
<li>An end-to-end demo of a hard-fought project went pretty well. We're functionally close, but far from where we need to be in terms of a professional-looking and -acting feature.</li>
<li>The Huskies won. As a Dawg in duckburg I'm torn – should I buy an away jersey (white) to wear around town or a home jersey (purple)?</li>
<li>New mentees continue to appear. Some of them aren't actually mentees but doing a little market or product research, but I don't mind as long as their questions are relevant to my interests. It's a tough time for entry-level UX people, but I hope I am helpful to them with my seemingly slightly-offbeat advice. Remember, it's the designer's job to do <em>the right thing</em> with the feedback they receive.</li>
</ul>

        <p>The month of October signals the end of the third quarter in our funny misaligned fiscal year. That's useful, in part because I promised some things by the end of the quarter, and a little push is a good thing. So,</p>
<ul>
<li>That little push helped me make progress with revamping a set of moribund customer profiles, and the latest increment of that work is now out for review. Thanks, October!</li>
<li>I got out and plugged in and noodled on my keyboard (nothing fancy, just an M-Audio KeyStation plugged into Garage Band), filling in little obligatoes to the usual evening Spotify soundtrack. Good fun, and long overdue.</li>
<li>Fancy pictures (MRI) of my knee reveal what seems a relatively simple explanation for the oddball problems I've been having and have been slowly worsening over years. (Can I afford the remedy? TBD.)</li>
</ul>

        <p>I got to the end of the week feeling like I worked hard but didn't accomplish much. Lots of managing, a lot less doing, and the things I said I would do by the end of the quarter are now hanging over my head a bit. But</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a solid plan for the number one item on that list, and the one thing that can truly block me from enacting that plan produces its own plan.</li>
<li>New mentees are finding me and so far I've been able to help each one. It's a mix of folks! Researchers, new designers, more senior folks, etc. Some of my advice has started to converge (apparently I'm consistent in what I think!), but I believe I'm giving an appropriate level of individual attention to each person and not spouting platitudes. I recognize that that's an available danger and promise to be vigilant.</li>
<li>I once joked that my superhero identity was &quot;explains-a-concept guy.&quot; It has been especially true this week.</li>
