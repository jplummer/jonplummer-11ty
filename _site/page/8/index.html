    <section>
        <p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com">Merlin Mann</a> is fond of saying &quot;you don't have to be nice, but you should be kind.&quot; In this statement &quot;nice&quot; refers to being agreeable, and &quot;kind&quot; to being friendly. These are not the same.</p>
<p>Men who prey on women depend on a woman's social conditioning to be nice, to be agreeable, AND to be kind, to be friendly, and in doing so put their target's desire for self-protection in conflict with their desire, often unconscious, to satisfy that conditioning. This is an extreme example but it illustrates the problem well; <em>nice</em> all-too-often becomes <em>self-negation</em>.</p>
<p>There's plenty of opportunity for self-negation in a business context; a classic example is making a request of a peer, and when that request is not fulfilled, not following up out of fear that you will be disliked.</p>
<p>In business, we are interdependent. We need things of others: of our superiors, of our subordinates, and of our peers. Without role power in play it is especially easy for our conditioning to be &quot;nice&quot; to trip up our interoperation with our peers. Not following up on an unmet expectation trains your peers that your requests don't matter. In effect you train others to ignore your needs if you do not consistently assert them. That's no way to be effective in your role. What's worse, it doesn't help your likability one whit.</p>
<p>So, start with a well-formed request: this is what I need, this is when I need it, this is why I need it. Thank the person for meeting that request. Follow up right away if it is unmet and negotiate a new deadline. Give the person context. Escalate as needed.</p>
<p>(You can skimp on the well-formed-ness of your requests once you've established trust that your wishes will regularly be met by this peer, in a timely manner, and that they will raise objections quickly and in good faith. Not before.)</p>
<p>Your kindness appears in these interactions when you do not interpret your peer's noncompliance as a personal attack. Your kindness is visible when every interaction, though your need has not been met, is pleasant and factual. Your kindness is made clear when you first escalate to your peer, then only if necessary escalate to a superior. Your kindness is exemplified when that escalation focuses on the unmet need first, and not the peer or your disappointment.</p>
<p>You don't have to be nice, but you should be kind. This means taking a charitable view of your peer's motivations and behavior, but nonetheless standing up for what you need, when, and why, and not letting things slide. You deserve to be effective in your job. And if you are kind, you are likely to be well-liked. Nice is not necessary.</p>

<li>My brother and his family visited the state. The drive to see them all and spend the night was mercifully easy, and a great time was had by all.</li>
<li>My presentation went well, senior leaders are recommending the recording of it to their people. The notion that quality hasn't been high enough and there's a central idea behind raising it is sinking in.</li>
<li>Quarterly coaching is finally in progress, and I'm ready for Monday morning. Not yet ready for Monday afternoon, though.</li>

<li>It's amazing what even one day away, far from the home and the projects and the email, can do. We had planned a two-day trip but the first night fell through. No matter – a night and a day exploring northern Oregon and the coast is time well-spent.</li>
<li>I'm ready for my presentation! Or as ready as I'm likely to be. I have plenty of time to rehearse and do a little polishing. Accept the pressure to perform as a sign that you're excited and should prepare, then prepare. It took me a little longer than usual to get to this point, this time, but I'm here now.</li>
<li>Just when I'm worried I'm not accomplishing enough my manager points out that he's happy to see the progress I'm making. Phew.</li>

        <p>The health scare has passed. That alone would be enough, <em>dayenu</em>. A little bit of this week was taken up by dealing with not having a good memory of what transpired the prior week. Even so,</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplification – as the SMS team learns more about the customers and how they can be helped with missed and after-hours calls, the proposed solution is becoming simpler rather than growing tentacles. That's a great sign; continued customer contact and analysis across those customers, rather than specific attention to any one of them, is driving this simplification.</li>
<li>Simplification – learning about the sales process with another leader from R&amp;D is causing us to explore simpler ways of trialing our product. And we had a breakthrough idea this week that will further simplify what we are prototyping, mostly taking the actual product and its attendant complexity out of the picture. This'll be cheap to try and could lead in so many interesting directions that it's really exciting.</li>
<li>Teamwork – the UX team is swarming on a key set of usability and capability improvements for our growth product, and it's going well. The newest member of the team, from a design process and output standpoint, is running rings around one of the more senior members. It's nice to see the development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I stopped procrastinating on a thing, and now the thing is moving well.</p>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>It seems like we have a pretty good grasp of what quality should be when it comes to infrastructure – what technical soundness is, how much load we should handle, what kind of logging, etc. but we are less mature regarding other dimensions of quality.</p>
<p>An interactive item in general availability, operated by customer users, should</p>
<ul>
<li>be valuable to specific users
<ul>
<li>deliver value in results and conveniences</li>
<li>minimize toil</li>
<li>and this should be verifiable by experiment and by monitoring success metrics/adoption rate/etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be usable by those users
<ul>
<li>intelligible
<ul>
<li>and this should be made more likely via concept testing, and somewhat verifiable by experiment and by monitoring success metrics/adoption rate/etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>obvious in expected actions and right action (design guideline)</li>
<li>makes success obvious (design guideline)</li>
<li>makes good use of familiar controls and interaction paradigms where possible (design guideline)</li>
<li>and this should be made more likely through user testing, and monitorable via success rate/time on task/error rate/etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be complete in its states, messages, and errors (design guideline)</li>
<li>be instrumented so we can witness users’ successes and difficulties</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s some disagreement about how important interactive quality might be for infrequently-operated configuration tasks in the platform. The irony is that an infrequently-operated item is not practiced frequently enough by a user to be well-learned, so it must be <em>more</em> obvious in its operation than something they do every day. So to the above there’s pressure to add</p>
<ul>
<li>be self-explanatory, relying on recognition rather than training and recall</li>
</ul>
<p>For products in a growth phase, where catering to new users and bringing them to intermediate proficiency is arguably more important than catering to existing power users, “be self-explanatory, relying on recognition rather than training and recall” is also important for the most critical, central workflows.</p>
<p>Some attention to interactive quality is important even in experiments, since poor interactive quality can confound our measurements. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is not usable we may not learn what we hope to learn from an experiment or a beta – since actual use will be hampered.</li>
<li>If it is unpleasant to use, its uptake will be blunted unless the value strongly outweighs the problems.</li>
<li>If it is not visually credible, confidence in its function will be blunted.</li>
<li>If it contains needless toil it will be unpleasant, time on task will be high, error rate may be high.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some confounding factors inhere more strongly to “complete” features rather than experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is incomplete in the intended use cases it will seem broken.</li>
<li>If it is incomplete in its states, messages, and errors for the covered use cases it will seem broken.</li>
<li>If it is not obvious it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</li>
<li>If it is not self-explanatory it has poor usability and increases the cost of training, which is backward from what we plan to do.</li>
<li>If it is poorly-labeled it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general idea is that scope should scale but quality should not. All of these are achievable in small scopes and if we care about quality are not “extra” costs.</p>
