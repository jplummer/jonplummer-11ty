    </header>
    <section>
        <p>I mentioned earlier that I think of UX research and design practice in three horizons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Horizon one, detail</strong>: creating detailed designs, testing those designs, preparing for shipping, supporting development, instrumentation</li>
<li><strong>Horizon two, concept</strong>: generating and selecting among concepts intended to deliver a chosen benefit</li>
<li><strong>Horizon three, benefit</strong>: learning about the problems people face and the benefits we might offer them to alleviate one or more of these problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal in horizon three is to</p>
<ol>
<li>understand the people we intend to serve, the work they are doing, and the difficulties that they face so well that we can</li>
<li>come up with multiple benefits we might offer these people, then</li>
<li>select among these according to their value to these people and to the business.</li>
</ol>
<p>To do this we have a handful of <strong>learn</strong> activities and a handful of <strong>make</strong> activities, in a learn/make/learn sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn
<ul>
<li>Examine about how people work in the domain in which we operate to detect difficulties or gaps in the experience (you'll recognize this as qualitative research), via
<ul>
<li>Interviews</li>
<li>Job shadowing</li>
<li>Customer advisory boards/focus groups</li>
<li>Surveys</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Measure how people use the product now, or alternatives to your product if you don't have a product yet (you'll recognize this as quantitative research), via
<ul>
<li>Testing existing experiences – summative testing</li>
<li>Reviewing sources of experience data
<ul>
<li>User success metrics and other user behavioral metrics</li>
<li>Support contacts themes and details</li>
<li>The frequency of error messages</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reviewing sources of user opinion data
<ul>
<li>Ratings and reviews</li>
<li>Customer complaints</li>
<li>Net Promoter scores and comments</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make
<ul>
<li>Generate a list of potential benefits – results that are desirable that don't mention the specific manner in which these results are delivered</li>
<li>Express each benefit in a way that works for your business, be it a benefit statement, a value proposition, a magical prototype, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn
<ul>
<li>Check each benefit for strategic fit – would deliver this benefit help us with our chosen strategy, or distract from it?</li>
<li>Check each benefit for product fit – would delivering this benefit strengthen the product's value proposition, or dilute it?</li>
<li>Examine each benefit with the help of the people you serve – to what extent would having this benefit appeal when compared with competing benefits? How well would this benefit address existing complaints or difficulties? Would this benefit encourage subscriptions, renewals, purchases? There are numerous tools to do this, including max diff survey, dot voting, landing page testing, crowdfunding, and many others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of this you'll have one or more high-scoring benefits and likely will already have gathered some ideas about how you might deliver each one. You're ready for horizon two, concept.</p>
<p>You can see that this phase is an example of a <a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/11/09/single-diamond-the-basic-form-of-the-creative-process/">single diamond creative process</a>, where we inform ourselves, generate multiple possibilities, then winnow down the possibilities into a select few that we think will be especially good.</p>

        <p>Last week I pointed out that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The moment I announced I am #openToWork on LinkedIn there was an inrush of good wishes and referrals and recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the past week I've noticed the stream of well-wishers, recommenders, and referrers continue. This reminds me that</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a bigger and better network than I give myself credit for</li>
<li>Some of those relationships have been surprisingly resilient (as I've not been the best about keeping in touch in most cases)</li>
<li>The people who have been recommending me have been recommending me for largely the same traits and activities. So these traits are real, and I can use this fact to let impostor syndrome calm down a little bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a second flood has begun – little tidbits that would be useful fodder for this blog or LinkedIn posts are becoming more apparent to me, and more often. I'm still wrestling with the &quot;what does the portfolio of a director look like&quot; issue, but I hope to have that sorted out soon, and I bet it will involve talking about how to get the work done more than the work itself..</p>

        <h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>A small incident today reminds me of the importance of explaining not just <em>what</em> action you'd like taken but <em>why</em>. I have found this to be true so often that it's become part of how I usually communicate with coworkers, supervisors, even my own family.</p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>The message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need either a new sewer outlet hose and a carrier to match, or just a new sewer outlet hose. Would prefer a longer hose and the ability to carry it. If using the existing carrier, there's a bolt missing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>became, through the telephone game</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longer sewer outlet hose with carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the work done merely</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Replaced two missing screws from carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with the note</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently has 47&quot; hose carrier, only has max 62&quot; space for different carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>missing the (completely accomplishable) goal entirely.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In August we took our little Airstream on a two-week trip from Oregon to Navajo country then back through some of the national parks of northern Arizona and southern Utah. It was an amazing trip, but we had a variety of mishaps with the trailer along the way. High winds carried off our radio antenna, we struggled with a blockage in the sewage tank, the toilet valve started to leak (not in a gross way), we lost a rivet inside, the awning started to spring back sluggishly and then not at all, we blew out a backflow preventer leading to a flood of fresh water coming out from behind the kitchen cabinet, etc. And in the very last days of the trip our 12-year-old sewer hose finally started to crack, leading to a small but unpleasant situation when we went to dump our waste water.</p>
<p>Naturally, once we arrived home we cleaned things up as best we could and made an appointment with our local service provider. Once I started to explain our list of issues they smartly asked me to email the list, which I did, explained in detail.</p>
<p>The drop off day arrived, and I dutifully explained each issue to the service writer, who had prepared a repair order based on the email. The service writer said he thought my explanations, email, and the repair order all made sense, and I handed him the keys.</p>
<p>Weeks passed, and I received a call saying the repairs were complete. We made an appointment for me to pick up the trailer.</p>
<h2>That brings us to today</h2>
<p>Today was pick up day, but I returned home empty-handed. All of the repairs were done satisfactorily but one: I had neither a new sewer hose nor a carrier to match. All that was done was to replace screws needed to hold the existing carrier in place.</p>
<p>Looking over the repair order, line two had only the instructions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longer sewer outlet hose with carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those aren't bad instructions, actually. If they had been fulfilled, I'd have taken the trailer home. Instead, the trailer still had the original hose and carrier.</p>
<p>Apparently the next size hose carrier is 64 inches long (162.5 science units) and there was only 62 inches of unobstructed space across the trailer to install a carrier, so the technician spotted and fixed what they could see as wrong, missing screws. They took a note to this effect</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently has 47&quot; hose carrier, only has max 62&quot; space for different carrier. Replaced two missing screws from carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and stopped work. The effect of this is that the most important part of my problem, needing a new sewer hose, was not remedied, and the least important, this too-short hose carrier being loose, was all that was worked on.</p>
<h2>What went wrong?</h2>
<p>I can think of a handful of different things that someone could have done to improve the situation. But the most charitable interpretation is that my goal</p>
<blockquote>
<p>new sewer outlet hose and a carrier to match, or just a new sewer outlet hose</p>
</blockquote>
<p>didn't make it to the technician. I probably have a hand in that miss, as does the service writer.</p>
<p>There also might be a little bit of <em><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/2012-09-07/ty-article/word-of-the-day-rosh-gadol/0000017f-e66d-dc7e-adff-f6ed883b0000">rosh gadol</a></em> at work here; come to find out also that I'm not stuck with my too-short 47 inch carrier or a too-long 64 inch carrier – there are adjustable hose carriers. And surely a technician can select a carrier, adjust it to a suitable length, test a new hose to see if it will fit, and finding a match install both and sell them to me.</p>
<p>(It also probably did not help that my expression of the goal included an &quot;or.&quot;)</p>
<h2>The remedy</h2>
<p>Today I told the service writer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My goal is to have a new sewer hose, and the means to carry it, installed on the trailer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exact manner of meeting that goal is open to interpretation, but if that goal makes it to the technician this time I'm confident I will have the result I seek.</p>
