        <p>Three wins for this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>It was less tricky than I feared to come up with four reasonable UX-led programs for the <a href="https://cayuse.com/connect2022/">Connect Conference</a> this October. I'm feeling more optimistic about my (and our) responsibilities for this conference than before.</li>
<li>The nutrition coach pointed out that I'm slightly underfeeding myself with occasional peaks to try to make up for it. Even with those peaks on average I'm a little below where I should be calorie-wise and well-below where I should be protein-wise. That explains why weight and energy have both been proceeding downward and workouts have been getting harder rather than easier. I now have targets that will help me make better choices.</li>
<li>I went for my first run in years, and it wasn't terrible. I went slow, paid attention to duration but not distance or pace, and tried to take it easy on my knee. I used the <a href="https://www.nike.com/nrc-app">Nike Run Club app</a>, since it's free. I'll do this a few more times before making a decision about schedule, shoes, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a little trickier than I expected to find the wins this week.</p>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p><a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/net-promoter-score/">Net Promoter Score</a> (NPS) is a popular and fashionable customer experience metric meant to express the loyalty of a company's customers. It's simple to administer, and since it's in widespread use a company can compare their results to others fairly easily.</p>
<p>The method is fairly simple: once each year, disconnected from any specific sales or customer service interaction, ask each of your registered users on a scale of zero to ten how likely they are to recommend your brand or product to a friend or colleague. If you're fancy you might also ask why they gave the number that they did.</p>
<p>The method of arriving at a score is also straightforward – subtract the percentage of respondents scoring six or below (detractors) from the percentage of respondents scoring nine or ten (promoters). You now have one number between 100 and –100. If that score is above zero you have more promoters than detractors. A higher NPS score is supposedly correlated with higher sales growth.</p>
<p>What's not to love?</p>
<p>Like other interesting tools such as <a href="https://www.strategicinsights.biz/if-i-had-a-hammer-brainstorming-misunderstood/">brainstorming</a> or <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/it/2022/02/09770437/1D9Gc1bNUNW">Agile</a>, NPS is commonly misunderstood and its practice distorted. People enthusiastic about the idea of NPS press an NPS-like survey into service in all sorts of off-label ways, sowing confusion within their companies. The most common distortions are</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Once each year…&quot;</strong> – It's common to receive an NPS-like question about this or that more often than yearly, increasing the likelihood that the next distortion will take place.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;…disconnected from any specific sales or customer service interaction…&quot;</strong> – It's especially common to receive NPS-like questions during or immediately after customer service interaction, sales interactions, etc. These are not NPS, as they are heavily influenced by the quality of a specific interaction.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;…ask each of your registered users…&quot;</strong> – If your users are not your customers, asking about user loyalty will garner different results than asking about customer loyalty.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;…on a scale of zero to ten…&quot;</strong> – This part of the NPS method is rarely violated.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;…how likely they are to recommend your brand or product to a friend or colleague.&quot;</strong> – This part of the NPS method is less commonly violated, but it does happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any one of these deviations would make your NPS-like survey <em>not</em> NPS. And one of them, confusing <em>users</em> with <em>customers</em> in situations where the two are distinct, is likely to produce misleading results.</p>
<p>It sort of sounds like I'm defending NPS, here, much as I would Agile or brainstorming. But I'm not. The real difficulties with NPS, if you manage to avoid the common traps above, are these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/where-net-promoter-score-goes-wrong">There's scant evidence that respondents' scores on an NPS survey are actually related to their recommendation behavior</a>. This isn't surprising when we consider that the NPS question &quot;how likely are you to…&quot; is asking that person to <em>speculate</em> about their future behavior, which is much less reliable than asking people to <em>report on</em> their past behavior. <a href="https://measuringu.com/article-summaries/measuring-customer-satisfaction-and-loyalty-improving-the-net-promoter-score/">“Satisfaction” and “liking” are better predictors of recommendations</a> than “likelihood to recommend.”</li>
<li><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jmkg.71.3.039">NPS is no better than more direct measures of customer satisfaction</a> at predicting sales growth.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Customer-Satisfaction-customer-experience-customers/dp/0955416116">NPS is not apparently predictive of other behaviors that demonstrate loyalty</a>, such as repeat purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not that you shouldn't use NPS at all. Just be aware of what it is and what it is not. Listen carefully for the real question behind your organization's wish to use NPS, and see if that question can be answered more directly.</p>

        <p>Three wins for this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never mind my thoughts about NPS, which I have not written up here but should (edit: See &quot;<a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/07/31/the-trouble-with-nps/">The trouble with NPS</a>&quot;). Our company Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is <strong>five</strong>. Five is not terrible as it's above zero, but it's not something to crow about either. That of my team is <strong>eighty</strong>. If you're curious about eNPS, <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/employee-net-promoter-score-enps-good-measure-engagement/">Qualtrics has an okay writeup</a>. Our engagement scores reflect a similar difference, albeit a bit less grand.</li>
<li>Workouts this week, while at the same weights and only slightly higher volume than last week, were unexpectedly much harder. I did 'em anyhow. This might have something to do with the third win; while I've been losing weight slowly, I've also been losing energy slowly.</li>
<li>I started with a <a href="https://www.triplecrownhealth.com">nutrition coach</a>. I'm in the &quot;write everything down and don't change anything&quot; phase, prior to recommendations. I'm not jazzed about taking progress photos, but I <strong>am</strong> excited about having a knowledgeable person help me steer my habits toward my goal of being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kViCSPXyU8U">above average</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have a good weekend.</p>

        <p>Past Belkin colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterson-d-ryan/">Ryan Peterson</a> recently began posting his &quot;weekly wins&quot; on LinkedIn. My impression is that he did this in part to steel his resolve during is (successful!) job search, and in part to begin a practice of positive self-talk. As he put it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find it easy to be encouraging and optimistic when talking about others. In the past, however, I have struggled to talk to myself in the same positive way.</p>
<p>Ryan Peterson, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterson-d-ryan_weeklywins-carecollaborationcuriosity-activity-6938577436657750016-jKvJ">Weekly Wins #1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But recognizing my own wins doesn’t come easily. We use 15Five at work, and each week are asked &quot;what went well last week?&quot; This is the hardest part of my 15Five check in to fill in. Ryan points out,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I've been struggling to overcome when identifying wins is to allow myself to accept a small win, such as getting lunch with my mom. Also just the practice of taking time to write them down is &quot;forcing&quot; me to be reflective. I'm optimistic that as I continue on this path it will become easier to identify my own wins, and I'll be able to model this for my family at home, and in the workplace.</p>
<p>Ryan Peterson, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterson-d-ryan_weeklywins-carecollaborationcuriosity-activity-6953939743474679808-yDfO">Weekly Wins #7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accepting a small win may also be a piece of my challenge.</p>
<p>I have already begin thanking others at work as a weekly practice, one I hope comes across as authentic; with this new practice I hope to foster an accurate feeling of regular accomplishment.</p>
<p>So! Three four wins for this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>I witnessed people on my team enthusiastically collaborating and demonstrating gratitude for each other, suggesting that my effort forming a cohesive team is working.</li>
<li>I helped an embattled product time seize the crisis-opportunity created by the diversion of their engineering staff with a solid research plan and a method to capture what they will learn as they prepare for a new take on their product.</li>
<li>I had a lovely meeting with someone in People Operations where I got a sneak peek into our culture survey results, lending credence to insights gained by looking at exit interview data.</li>
<li>I used <a href="https://localwp.com">Local</a> to transform my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6_PXXjU94">slow-as-something-really-slow</a> blog into a speedy static site. I'm not shilling for Local, here; it just seemed like a quick way to make this change.</li>
</ol>
<p>Same time next week?</p>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>A recent correspondent asked how to move his team from &quot;thoughts and fears about plans&quot; to action, and I suggestion making their next intervention a <em>pilot</em>. That way an intervention is an <em>experiment</em>, and can be evaluated, then continued, tweaked, or ended.</p>
<p>I counseled him to consider coaching folks to articulate</p>
<ul>
<li>the problem we see</li>
<li>the result we want</li>
<li>what we'll try, for how long</li>
<li>how we will know if it is working or not</li>
<li>how we will know if we should stop the pilot early</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the pilot you can evaluate the results and decide to</p>
<ul>
<li>continue as-is</li>
<li>continue with tweaks</li>
<li>try something else</li>
<li>stop altogether</li>
</ul>
<p>with the same five points above for any change or new intervention.</p>
