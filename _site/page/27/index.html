    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Heather asked me yesterday &quot;who owns accessibility?&quot; That's a fun question. I replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accessibility is not owned. Who owns quality? It's a team responsibility. To the extent that accessibility compliance, or release date, or the P&amp;L is a &quot;feature&quot; of a piece of software it is owned by the PM, but each function has its responsibilities in accomplishing accessibility. Making these responsibilities explicit is necessary.</p>
<p>The folks with responsibilities mainly include UX (designing for accessibility), FED (engineering for accessibility), QA (inspection), and PM/PO (prioritization). These aren't collected in one person's purview around here until the CEO, so that's not the answer to your question.</p>
<p>If we are to be product-led and not sales-led, PM has to insist on it (and manage competing priorities), maybe that's part of the answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;ownership&quot; urge seems to sometimes dilute or deprioritize the responsibilities of others, which is a shame because we must work in concert.</p>

        <p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/laura-cotterill_martycagan-inspired-productmanagement-activity-6849597991393783808-gKTe">her post on LinkedIn</a>, Laura Cotterill (one of my new coworkers) refers to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ericchanjq_martycagan-inspired-productmanagement-activity-6847770608042942464-jf5r/">Eric Chan's post about teamwork</a> and wonders why such a seemingly obvious mode of work is out of reach so much of the time. To which <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6849597991393783808?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6849597991393783808%2C6849709900071878657%29">I responded</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My impression is:</p>
<ol>
<li>When we pressure people to overproduce we encourage them to defend themselves in ways that seem locally sensible but turn out to be anti-collaborative.</li>
<li>Financial planning, especially when the business is not self-funded, tends to require a forecast; that forecast hangs from a roadmap, effort estimates, and sales targets.</li>
<li>When a business sees the sales team as its economic engine rather than the product itself (sales teams tend to be good at preserving this impression), opportunities detected by sales get pushed onto that roadmap with less discussion than necessary.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Of these I find the first the most pernicious.</p>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>As of nine weeks ago I have a new job at Cayuse. But how do I explain my accomplishments on LinkedIn when I'm so new?</p>
<p>Maybe I don't. What if I instead explain what I am there to do? What would that be like?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am building a design and research team to support the collection of 25+ disparate built and acquired products into a single coherent suite. Since I've recently begun, here's what I plan to accomplish:<br>
• Develop UX and UI design capacity and capability<br>
• Add and develop UX research capability<br>
• Install formative usability testing during design to de-risk detailed design decisions<br>
• Install user insights research, concept design and validation<br>
• Stand up a team and processes to build and improve a design system in visuals and code, for the product suite<br>
• Gather and improve product personas to be an informative smaller set of personas for the entire suite<br>
• Begin instrumentation of new features, to measure outcomes, by determining desired outcomes at the epic level<br>
• Help the product team take advantage of existing pre-customer and post-launch data, such as customer success contact data, support forum and knowledge base behavior, RFP mining, sales demo feedback, etc.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I suppose over time I could exchange some of these for my accomplishments and my new plan. I've not seen this anywhere else. Good idea? Bad idea?</p>

    <section>
        <p>In the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/37821/">Design Thinking group on LinkedIn</a>, Sara Bermúdez <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6841731698523291648/">asked</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would love to hear your opinions on which are the most important mindsets for the future of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:groupPost:37821-6841721798678212608?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28groupPost%3A37821-6841721798678212608%2C6841756174824669184%29">I had a take</a> on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find I often have to nudge people out of what I've come to call constraint-based thinking. Focusing on and reacting to the apparent constraints in a situation can lead to a poor solution and a feeling of being stuck with that poor solution, a double-whammy of negativity. &quot;We couldn't do X because of A, we couldn't do Y because of B, so we're stuck with Z, like it or not.&quot; Chances are good that there's a way to meet the goal that manages or makes irrelevant these constraints that you'll be happier with than where you are seemingly stuck, but it requires exploring ways to meet the goal rather than rattling around in a box of obstacles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steven Forth responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there skills we can cultivate that helps us escape from the self-imposed constraints of constraint based thinking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I elaborated a bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure. Some are implied above.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify and articulate a <em>goal</em> as a <em>benefit</em> (where a benefit is the happy result NOT expressed in terms of exactly how it is delivered).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider a person's needs and a business's needs together rather than separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When confronted with a problem or pain point, learn about and offer possible benefits (some folks call them &quot;gain points&quot;) rather than solutions, at first. Later you can design or select a way to deliver that benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think in scenarios: <em>who</em> arrives in <em>what</em> situation, <em>when</em> and <em>where</em>, with <em>which</em> need or goal to address or accomplish, and <em>what</em> can the system (or organization, etc.) offer them?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that most of these thoughts require a <em>positive wording</em> of the situation or aim rather than a <em>negative wording</em>. This might be the key skill, broadly useful but not sufficient on its own. You'll see this in health fields when practitioners take a wellness perspective—rather than cease some harmful behavior like smoking, they'll talk about replacing the habits associated with smoking with healthier rituals, moving nicotine delivery to a less-harmful medium where it can be managed, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many other good comments there.</p>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Gentle people,<br>
I recently complained to the directors and project managers about meeting invitations</p>
<ul>
<li>without agendas, or</li>
<li>without a clear goal, or</li>
<li>without a sense of what a person might be expected to do in a meeting, or</li>
<li>without a sense of what person might need to do to prepare for a meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that, generally, the project managers aren't to blame here. The VPs and directors are to blame more than we should be, but especially the populace—most folks are not that great about helping the folks they invite to a meeting be ready for that meeting.</p>
<p>This is a thing that design folks can be especially good at. We're accustomed to thinking about others and their needs. All we need to do is remember to think about these at the moment we are scheduling the meeting.</p>
<p>The people who are coming to your meeting need to know what the meeting is meant to accomplish and how they are going to be useful. Please tell them by including that information in the invitation.</p>
<p>If we get good at this, others will notice.</p>
