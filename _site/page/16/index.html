<li>My six phase benefit/concept/detail process is going to be piloted in our growth product.</li>
<li>A work relationship that started with a little contention has become a cordial, iron-sharpens-iron collaboration. Tough but fair, I love it.</li>
<li>I've been able to refer or be a reference to three former coworkers in the past two weeks. It's nice to know how you can help.</li>
<li>A couple of weekends ago I chose to do a project for a relative with whom I've had a contentious relationship. This turns out to have been a great choice. I finished the project this weekend; it's nice to feel a sense of accomplishment and to have set a new tone in our relationship, and it cost me only time.</li>

    <section>
        <p>Just like the <em>false tradeoff</em> between security and usability, I don’t want to play into the notion that light scope and quality are opposing forces. We will not make progress if we habitually shortchange quality. An “MVP” of poor experience quality is certainly “minimum” but forgets the “viable” and a bit of the “product.” You could say it is actually below &quot;minimum.&quot; For another take on this, see Jason Cohen's <a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html">Simple, Lovable, Complete</a>.</p>

        <ul>
<li>This is the first week in quite a while that I fulfilled all of my at-work weekly objectives. Sometimes lowering your sights slightly can pay off. Yet I also feel I accomplished more than recent weeks. It's probably a combination of smaller, more accomplishable (therefore likely better-defined) objectives and actual progress on a thing that's been lingering for a while. We'll see if this is a trick or a technique.</li>
<li>Having to explain my thoughts about product research/design/development to folks I work with, and having them ask me to operationalize parts of it they don't fully understand, has led me to explaining some of the concepts from new angles. This is challenging my thinking and helping me to firm it up.</li>
<li>I had a lovely chat with a person who is contemplating moving from designer to design manager. I find this sort of thing rewarding because I like helping, and I like meeting people, and because it reminds me of what I've learned, what I think, and to listen first. It's tempting to opine, but only valuable lightly and if that opinion is actually relevant to the person's situation or question.</li>

        <p>Be it version three or an MVP, the experience we deliver should</p>
<ul>
<li>be valuable to specific users</li>
<li>be usable by those users</li>
<li>conform to or enhance the user's understanding of the subject area</li>
<li>be pleasant to use</li>
<li>be visually polished</li>
<li>deliver value in results and conveniences</li>
<li>minimize toil</li>
<li>be complete in its delivery of the uses we offer</li>
<li>be complete in its states, messages, and errors</li>
<li>make good use of familiar controls and interaction paradigms</li>
<li>make success obvious</li>
<li>be obvious in expected actions and right action</li>
<li>be self-explanatory, relying on recognition rather than training and recall</li>
<li>be well-labeled</li>
<li>be instrumented so we can witness users' successes and difficulties</li>
</ul>
<p>…even if the scope is small, even if it's a little slice of functionality from a bigger, longer-term plan, even if it is a fragment of the excellent future we envision. Even the basics should be built completely, with thoughtfulness and pride.</p>

<li>I installed a bluteotth kit behind the factory car stereo in the 2006 Matrix and
<ul>
<li>it worked on the first try,</li>
<li>it sounds great,</li>
<li>pairing was easy and the connection seems reliable, and</li>
<li>in doing so I accidentally fixed the clock.</li>
<li>I also found a decent way to plug the hole in the dash left by the old aux in jack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There's a personnel issue at work, but it has a bright side and is totally surmountable. It is very likely that the parties involved will grow as a result. That's not an easy way to get growth, but I'll take it, this time.</li>
<li>I hit a new one-rep deadlift max on Wednesday. 365lbs is a far cry from the max of my youth or even of a decade ago, but I can see my way to exceeding those with time. Forward!</li>
