    </header>
    <section>
        <p>I was talking with a mentee today when the topic of authenticity came up – if we are thinking so much about how we should behave, how do we know what is authentic? It seems like authenticity should be effortless – why is it so hard? (The below comments are only lightly specific to the mentee's situation.)</p>
<p>Authenticity does not mean being unfiltered, unmodulated, completely ego-expressive. Instead, we are behaving authentically when our actions and our motivations and our sense of self are aligned with one another.</p>
<p>Your physical posture is how you hold your body, arrange your limbs and whatnot, and that posture affects your comfort and your behavior. For example, slouching leads to back fatigue, reduced lung capacity, and feelings of &quot;being down,&quot; and the behavioral effects flowing from these physical effects. We remind ourselves to sit up comfortably straight in part because we genuinely want the positive effects that this posture will bring, therefore the posture is authentic – even though we had to remember to do it, taking that posture matches our motivations.</p>
<p>What are the intellectual and social/emotional analogs of physical posture?</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual posture</strong> – how you hold your mind/thought: What is an intellectual posture that makes you ready to consider the current tactical need, the comments of others, and the strategic situation without causing internal conflict? What is the intellectual frame you can put around what's happening to recognize the problem to be solved and your place in the solution? This is useful for your own well-being and effectiveness, and becomes visible to others through your behavior. Your behavior is authentic if it matches your actual intellectual posture, and inauthentic if these don't match. You change your intellectual posture in response to your motivations; if your motivations and posture match, the posture is (and your behavior will thus be) authentic.
<strong>Social posture</strong> – how you hold your heart: when entering a situation at work or socially, what are you hoping will happen? What sort of interactions would you like to have? These wishes motivate your social posture. What is your role to play in achieving interactions of the sort you would like to have? What attitude do you portray as part of playing that role? This is your social posture. Your social posture and the behavior it fosters can be authentic or inauthentic; if the wishes and the posture and the behavior are all in alignment, then they are authentic.</p>
<p>You may not be able to be perfectly authentic all the time. It takes practice. It gets easier if you can bring your goals and posture to consciousness (e.g., if you can think about them, observe them, reflect on their effect on the recent past) and behave in a way that is congruent with them. Sometimes it's hard to get all three at once – but even struggling with these is authentic. Is it easier (even just a little) to model what you want at work or at home? Or even with just one friend? Practice where it is easier for a while.</p>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Much of the week was spent on-site, meeting with my R&amp;D leadership peers (and the thin layer of execs above us) to figure out what behavior should to change to change our results. Strangely enough, this group not met since well before I started, and much of the contact I've had with these people has been in 1:1s, small meetings, or in some cases not at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>Naturally this was the first time at this job I've had that &quot;<a href="https://www.michaelvizdos.com/resources/first-team">first team</a>&quot; feeling, which has been long overdue. It's great that we were able to get from a little icy to working together openly in less than a day, the first day.</li>
<li>Since the agenda was less agenda-like that I typically feel comfortable with, my main goals were to represent myself and my team well and to genuinely engage with the topics as a knowledgeable and connected member of the team. I think I did that, and so do several people I've checked with.</li>
<li>Last week I mentioned that a deadline helped me, &quot;having written and received helpful comments on many pages of pre-read material.&quot; It turns out that several months ago our CEO encouraged pre-reads as a way to accelerate meetings. Little did I know. But with this group it works; the discussion that happened in these documents meant that when we sat down together we had a basis of agreement and a pretty good understanding of where controversy remained, and could get into the substance quickly and without too much preamble. (This isn't the same as the Amazon method of bringing a document and reading it quietly together to start a meeting.)</li>
<li>I had my first &quot;quarterly coaching&quot; conversation with my boss, and it went better than I expected.</li>
</ul>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>I've shared this verbatim with my team and pointed out how it will affect our work in the coming quarter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon has done a great job ramping up on all things Invoca and focusing on building out the UX discipline and helping push us to be more customer centric.</p>
<p>Jon has balanced time improving processes/personnel within the UX group (for ex: instituting the weekly design critique meeting) and helping create the right conditions for UX to succeed with key stakeholders (primarily PM &amp; ENG leadership). I believe this overall area should continue to be Jon's Q2 focus while begining to take steps to evangelize and show off results of UX output to stakeholders. We discussed a few ideas such as Trios sharing/demoing their work in settings like Invocation, CKO, Company Connect. Jon &amp; team have also started using Lattice to publicly praise good work in Slack.</p>
<p>Other candidates for UX growth discussed:<br>
* Building out UX personas/profiles under 'business centers' - to be used both in product development and by the organization to be more customer-centric and raise the visibility of UX.<br>
* Building muscles as a trio and working projects in scoped iterations en route to GA vs. larger chunks shipped.<br>
* Removing barriers or reliance on PM/others for UX to get more direct interaction with customers; having UX lead respective customer sessions (and bringing insights back to the teams) vs. being in the passenger seat.<br>
* Jon &amp; team potentially spending more time learning the product in conjunction with projects and their focus areas in the platform.</p>
<p>I also want to call out the good work Jon has done building trust and goodwill with the 'First Team' in R&amp;D. I hope we can continue to focus on problems and improvement areas collectively (being open to sharing in the leadership Slack channel, etc) and use 1:1 discussions as warranted vs. the way to solve problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty good?</p>

        <ul>
<li>Quarterly coaching is done. I might be the first to complete it among the managers.</li>
<li>Our pilot recruiting of prospective research participants (recruit them before you need them) has begun.</li>
<li>I'm hatching a plot to investigate &quot;diving saves&quot; performed by our support team to find and sell revenue-linked usability project to the PM team. In a moment where general experience improvements are met with skepticism, making the effect on the customer of action or inaction really clear is critical. And I have a handful of ideas where to find other such improvement possibilities.</li>
<li>I'm feeling mostly ready for our leadership on-site next week (I guess it's an on-site when remote people come together at HQ?) having written and received helpful comments on many pages of pre-read material. A deadline helps!</li>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>It's common for non-design folks to assume that research and design rigor will slow the overall process down. (I've heard epithets such as &quot;constipate&quot; – unpleasant and rude.) How might the UX team contribute to speed of value delivery?</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving our understanding of our customers (and especially of our users) so that we can make better decisions about direction, scope, interactive details, etc. and especially things <em>not</em> to build. The fastest feature is one you don't build.</li>
<li>Ensuring that every design intervention is a response to a user or customer problem or a benefit that we are sure our customers will value. This is a subset of the above, but deserves special mention because a cool idea is <em>not actually cool</em> unless the person we hope to serve will appreciate the benefit it delivers enough to pay for it.</li>
<li>Answering business questions through small doses (in pharmacology the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose_(pharmacology)">minimum effective dose</a>) of research, concept evaluation, and usability testing.</li>
<li>Helping to manage scope by offering simpler alternatives that users can use to possibly meet seemingly more complicated needs. This is sometimes the opposite of what UX is tempted to do.</li>
<li>Uncovering opportunities to improve usefulness and usability to improve adoption, retention, and time-to-value, which make the business itself faster and more efficient.</li>
<li>Delivering detailed designs, business roles, states, labels, etc. at an appropriate level of fidelity and no fancier, incorporating many elements only by reference to the design system.</li>
<li>Continuously improving the design system so interfaces can be built faster and with greater consistency, and to steadily improve the usability, familiarity, and accessibility of capabilities delivered on the front-end.</li>
</ul>
<p>And everyone should practice <a href="/2023/05/20/active-project-self-management/">active self-management within the project</a>.</p>
