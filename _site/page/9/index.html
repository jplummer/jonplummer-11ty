        <p>The week was dominated by a health scare that continues. Even so,</p>
<ul>
<li>My spirits are fairly light.</li>
<li>No one (yet) is feeding me their crackpot health advice.</li>
<li>It's really two issues that can be managed separately, and only one is a significant concern, so I'm free to focus on it.</li>
<li>I felt not a twinge of guilt taking the day off on Wednesday to focus on this item.</li>
<li>I and others have been kind with me spreading the workday out more gently. My concentration is off, but my reasoning is just as good as it has been, so I'm still useful to my charges…</li>
<li>…and to the fellow that might be a new mentee; I was able to give him a little bit of help even in our &quot;getting to know you&quot; session.</li>

        <p>This was not an easy week. Several things went at least a little sideways: Tuesday's workout wrung me out; Saturday's was cut short by a whopper of a headache; I recognized that I've taken on too many projects; several people were out and despite all of our preparation that did cause some disconcert in projects; I procrastinated on a thing I really care about and made no progress on it all week. And yet there is gold among the sand:</p>
<ul>
<li>A key project beset by inter-group politics, misunderstandings, and misapprehensions is seeing the politics die down and the plan emerge. And in response to a critical misunderstanding involving my team (no, while the key designer is out design capacity will not rise, but we do have a plan to maintain it and a plan to raise it further over time) a very nice meeting was had to negotiate scope. No voices raised, no disappointments even. Everyone played fair and it seems that everyone is happy with the result.</li>
<li>Procrastinating on the thing I really care about that I procrastinated on made room for a handful of other needed things that, while not as important, helped me make progress on a few of the too-many projects. <a href="https://structuredprocrastination.com">Structured procrastination</a> FTW?</li>
<li>…and Thursday's lifts went up just fine, while the prior Thursday was a struggle with some of them not completed. Bodies, they are strange things.</li>
</ul>

        <p>It was a short week, and that brings danger that people will try to cram five weeks of meetings and activity into three. This happened, alas. Even so,</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving people the (exceptional) option to skip critique or 1:1 for this short week provided a little relief to folks chasing urgent projects, even though few took advantage. (Schedule relief for those who did, psychological relief for those who did not.)</li>
<li>A plan came together (with coaching, but that's fine) to distribute work among the team to keep things moving as people get into their suppertime time away from work. We'll have a smaller crew than usual next week but everything that needs to move will keep moving.</li>
<li>Is the team getting the messages I'm sending more consistently, that superficial aesthetic variation is not interesting but informational and interactive design exploration, aimed at well-expressed informational and interactive goals, is? Yes, mostly. Not everyone all the way, but yes, mostly.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Scattered wins this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>After three tries (all administrative or preparation missteps of one sort or another) the girl now has a learner's permit; a small but crucial step toward learning a few adult skills.</li>
<li>Disconcert between two teams is giving way to eagerness and collaboration. Three things I often talk about are helping us along:
<ol>
<li>referring to real customer data,</li>
<li>finding and negotiating common goals, and</li>
<li>humans remembering to relate to one another.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A couple of the people I support are getting the message that attention to detail must be demonstrated. (In the details! Surprise.) This has required some tight feedback loops, but I think I'm successfully avoiding micromanaging.</li>
<li>Mentorship is fun! I might have a new mentee, perhaps just for the duration of their job search.</li>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Group coaching is valuable when the message is positive (&quot;I invite you to do this&quot;) and useful to all and there's no need to single someone out, or when singling someone out would be more pointed than the situation warrants. It allows the saving of face. Small issues such as not having the correct email signature, failing to make a fresh pot of coffee when taking the last cup, etc.</p>
<p>I used group coaching today when I pointed out to my team that, yes, the time slots in our weekly critique are short and it is hard to go deep, but I invite them to pursue feedback in other ways as well (and listed some ways). There were two people who needed that message the most, but it was relevant to all of them.</p>
<p>It's not the same thing as complaining to someone about problematic behavior, or escalating this complaint to their supervisor, which are more inherently pointed or even confronting.</p>
<p>We all wish that people would come directly to us individually for their wishes and corrections, but sometimes they are not sure they should, or don't want to confront, or are nervous about their skills in such an interaction, or don't want to make a big deal of it, or mention it in passing in more established relationships, or…myriad options.</p>
<p>(If you spend too much effort parsing the behavior of others you are likely to do the same for your own behavior, or vice versa, which will make it harder to relax and act in the moment. When I find myself stressed about how someone else's complaint came to me I try to set aside the manner and just focus on the content. Often there's at least a little something right in the complaint.)</p>
