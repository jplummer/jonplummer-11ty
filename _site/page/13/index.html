        <ul>
<li>An oft-rescheduled and contentious meeting resulted in a resolution to work together more often and more closely, which is the right answer.</li>
<li>I made progress on (many of) the things this week!</li>
<li>By speaking freely about what I'm working on (for a change) I've found folks who are interested in the results, interested in the process, interested in helping, or who might combine their work and mine to make something even more interesting. Of course! Yet I quickly forget that this is usually the case, especially when I'm feeling sheepish about my progress.</li>
<li>My hygiene and nutrition has been adequate for another trip around the sun. Many happy returns!</li>
</ul>

        <ul>
<li>Every Thursday I do a ladder of deadlifts – a couple light warmup sets, a handful of medium-heavy work sets, a heavyish couple/few reps, and a couple of legitimately heavy (for me) ones. I go double-overhand as long as I can, switching to a mixed grip once the bar starts to slip out of my hands. That used to happen around the end of the work sets; this week I got all the way to the final &quot;legitimately heavy&quot; set before having to switch grips. Getting better!</li>
<li>I finally managed to schedule some unpleasant diagnostic things I had been avoiding, a volunteer stint at the school district, shoulder PT, and close a lingering needless account by riding the momentum of just getting started. Just chipping off a chunk of a big problem and getting started is an underappreciated skill. (And it's astonishing how deeply broken the US healthcare system is even for someone as healthy as I seem to be.)</li>
<li>The people I support are visibly responding to my coaching. That's a win every time!</li>
</ul>

        <p>I' need'll start to keep track of wins as they happen; trying to remember all that happened last week is not easy.</p>
<ul>
<li>My &quot;plan&quot; has been reviewed by my team and my boss without much objection – time to double-check it for intelligibility and broaden the audience.</li>
<li>One conclusion of discussion last week is that there's widespread disagreement about how well we understand our users. This leads me to believe that the real answer is &quot;not very well.&quot; This is a win in that it makes they way forward much clearer. (There might also be some confusion around users versus customers here.)</li>
<li>My boss' team meeting is about to get a lot spicier – he'll have some news as usual, but we're all expected to bring statuses (though <strong>not statusing</strong> (future article)!) and discussion topics. I'm full of that stuff, and it'll be good to have the opportunity to <strong>display accountability</strong> (future article).</li>

<li>Good Friday Spring Holiday – this day off caught many at work by pleasant surprise.</li>
<li>A chat with the SVP of Engineering reminded me that I'm overdue on publicizing and gathering support for the high-level version of my plan for the department. My goal for the week is set!</li>
<li>While Swift syntax is distinctly weird to my &quot;C-like&quot; early Javascrip-trained eyes, plowing through the Apple-provided tutorials is helpful. Somewhat. Even so, the use/placement of dots in something like the following is distinctly odd to me:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>VStack() {
	Image(systemName: &quot;pin&quot;)
		.imageScale(.large)
		.foregroundColor(.accentColor)
	Text(&quot;Placeholder text for now&quot;)
}
.padding()
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, I'm team tabs.</p>

<li>It wasn't COVID-19, just a sinus infection that dripped into crevices and alarmed passers-by. I'm nearly 100% now.</li>
<li>Nothing caught on fire while I was out.</li>
<li>The hackathon a few weeks ago was inspiring enough that I've started to learn a little but about iOS app development to fulfill a personal project. Since my last real coding experience was a bunch of kooky javascript stuff around the turn of the century I'm well out of my depth, but it's both fun and frustrating; there's a point at which I'm familiar, I'm familiar, I'm familiar with the concepts in a tutorial and then <em>whap</em> I'm met with something totally baffling. As the ultramarathoners say, <a href="https://ultrarunning.com/features/relentless-forward-motion/">RFM</a>.</li>
