        <p>I' need'll start to keep track of wins as they happen; trying to remember all that happened last week is not easy.</p>
<ul>
<li>My &quot;plan&quot; has been reviewed by my team and my boss without much objection – time to double-check it for intelligibility and broaden the audience.</li>
<li>One conclusion of discussion last week is that there's widespread disagreement about how well we understand our users. This leads me to believe that the real answer is &quot;not very well.&quot; This is a win in that it makes they way forward much clearer. (There might also be some confusion around users versus customers here.)</li>
<li>My boss' team meeting is about to get a lot spicier – he'll have some news as usual, but we're all expected to bring statuses (though <strong>not statusing</strong> (future article)!) and discussion topics. I'm full of that stuff, and it'll be good to have the opportunity to <strong>display accountability</strong> (future article).</li>
</ul>

<li>Good Friday Spring Holiday – this day off caught many at work by pleasant surprise.</li>
<li>A chat with the SVP of Engineering reminded me that I'm overdue on publicizing and gathering support for the high-level version of my plan for the department. My goal for the week is set!</li>
<li>While Swift syntax is distinctly weird to my &quot;C-like&quot; early Javascrip-trained eyes, plowing through the Apple-provided tutorials is helpful. Somewhat. Even so, the use/placement of dots in something like the following is distinctly odd to me:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>VStack() {
	Image(systemName: &quot;pin&quot;)
		.imageScale(.large)
		.foregroundColor(.accentColor)
	Text(&quot;Placeholder text for now&quot;)
}
.padding()
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, I'm team tabs.</p>

<li>It wasn't COVID-19, just a sinus infection that dripped into crevices and alarmed passers-by. I'm nearly 100% now.</li>
<li>Nothing caught on fire while I was out.</li>
<li>The hackathon a few weeks ago was inspiring enough that I've started to learn a little but about iOS app development to fulfill a personal project. Since my last real coding experience was a bunch of kooky javascript stuff around the turn of the century I'm well out of my depth, but it's both fun and frustrating; there's a point at which I'm familiar, I'm familiar, I'm familiar with the concepts in a tutorial and then <em>whap</em> I'm met with something totally baffling. As the ultramarathoners say, <a href="https://ultrarunning.com/features/relentless-forward-motion/">RFM</a>.</li>

        <p>It's spring break, that awkward nearly month-long period when employees with kids start disappearing for a week at a time. Every year the challenge is to make sure that people have prepared their teams for their absence; that enough is done and questions answered (and backup help secured) that whoever remains can proceed without much trouble, and especially that the person's absence doesn't come as a surprise.</p>
<p>When I asked each person this week &quot;what do we need to do to prepare your team for your absence&quot; each person's answer started with what they've already done. That's a big win.</p>

        <p>Last week was all about an off-site meeting involving the product and engineering groups.</p>
<p>(What does off-site mean in today's remote-first environment? Never mind.)</p>
<ul>
<li>It was a good set of sessions! in particular, the hackathon presentations were funny and inspiring. Enough so that I'm tempted to get back into coding a little. Maybe I could hack(athon) a bit one day.</li>
<li>My team really came together working on our &quot;elevator-pitch-style&quot; team charter. I have some homework to do to set us up for the last step, but it's a pleasure to collect the good thoughts of good people trying hard to improve.</li>
<li>A coworker made their displeasure with the past UX regime abundantly clear in a group setting, and I decided I would not let it bother me. Even so, it did, for a bit. But later when we talked about it and I <strong>told them</strong> I had decided not to let it bother me, it <strong>actually</strong> no longer bothered me. It worked!</li>
</ul>
