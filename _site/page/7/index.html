<li>Driving lessons with the girl seem to be going well, especially since we've borrowed an automatic so we can learn to drive before we learn to drive stick. It has opened things up considerably.</li>
<li>I had my review and it went well. I'll share some of the results in a subsequent post.</li>
<li>Football season has begun and there is optimism for <em>both</em> Seattle teams. Hooray.</li>

        <p>(Quotations are my words, all else are the words of my manager.)</p>
<h2>Revision to goals for the quarter</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Step into responsiveness via the design system – propose to R&amp;D why and a way forward to get us to accommodate actual user viewport sizes better, and get a resulting project onto the roadmap</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't have the strongest opinion on this one and bucket it similarly to chipping away at general UX improvements. I don't want to dig the hole deeper – anything net new we develop would ideally have a higher bar of usability prior to general release – but would need to see specific examples with LOE of more general improvement candidates to weigh in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improve the quality of UX delivery – establish Figma delivery conventions specifically intended to reduce the cognitive load on developers, with developer input and feedback, and pilot these new conventions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strongly agree with this one and I appreciate how Jon scoped the specific action item this quarter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advocate for an appropriate level of UX/UI polish to survive engineering delivery by spreading the UX review cycle currently piloted via Smart Alerts and Call Review projects to other teams/crews</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also in strong agreement here but with the most Q3 emphasis being on Call Review &amp; Coaching-related projects if we had to prioritize where Jon spends his time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advocate for and begin a project to do POC IAs for various user types to explore the sensibility and difficulty of separating [product A] and [product B]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We talked about modifying this one a bit as some of the groundwork on [product B] is in place. I let Jon know that I have a Q3 goal with [PM] to revamp the [product A] product vision/strategy which will surely need UX input as stakeholders and that ideally better defines where UX output can be helpful for [product A] future IA and candidates for usability improvement.​</p>
<h2>Values</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Light The Customer's Way</strong>: [evident in] the improvements we've made to UX quality in recent releases and stronger focus on customer adoption and usability.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: Jon's involvement in many of the organizational &amp; process improvements we've rolled out in recent months, ensuring UX had a seat at the table ahead of making these changes and providing his perspective that influenced the solutions we implemented.​</li>
</ul>
<h2>Past Quarter's Results</h2>
<p>Jon has done a fantastic job improving both the quality of UX output at Invoca and building buy-in for user/customer-centric activities. He receives positive feedback from cross-department stakeholders and I am grateful to have him leading UX efforts. Key examples of Jon's leveling up of UX in recent months:</p>
<ul>
<li>His participation at Dallas and May offsites, particularly the lead up to our leadership offsite and his help with material preparation and follow through.</li>
<li>His very well-received Connect talk that summarized/connected the dots on many of the changes we had been looking to drive following our offsite discussions - trios, experimentation, shipping value/quality vs. speed, etc.</li>
<li>Leveling up members on the UX team and helping define new shaping frameworks to set them up for success. Also, pushing the team to have more direct customer/user feedback sessions.I hope Jon recognizes how far we've come in a short time (no longer prioritizing by service area vs. customer needs) and I'm excited to continue the journey with him.</li>
</ul>
<p>​2 – Right On Track</p>

<li>Quarterly coaching is done! Yay. There were no surprises, as expected. People offered and acknowledged their areas of grown, which is a good sign.</li>
<li>I wrote a <em>screed</em> in the R&amp;D leadership Slack channel and it was well-received. Now I have to help put my complaint into operation; I feel renewed energy for that.</li>
<li>I figured out how to avoid the &quot;vapor lock&quot; many reveal people experience when discussing a vast problem space. It's probably nothing new technique-wise, but already the discussions I'm having are more operationally useful than they were before because we're getting around the temptation to zoom out and hand-wave.</li>

        <p><a href="https://getmatter.com/email/29711227/?token=29711227%3A6VAqDDvgDkVW6ill7qMdL_XynzM">This article is worth a read as-is</a>. But once you’ve done that, consider that our users are also suffering a form of the paper cut tax since they need to (and due to the tax are told to) see their CSMs about every little thing they want to change on the platform. Poor usability is a brake on their productivity and, in turn, a brake on their esteem for our company.</p>
<p>The story I am told regularly is that usability in existing interfaces hasn’t been addressed because it is hard to relate to ROI. That’s true. That also does not make it less important. As we do with other types of issues, I think we should devote a percentage of our collective effort to chipping away at the large experience debt we have in the platform.</p>
<p>A small but potentially high-signal example: yesterday a few UXers including me attended “Mastering the Basics,” a webinar meant to introduce new customers to a handful of typical operations on the platform. It was lengthy and dense, intelligibility issues were apparent (nay, obvious) at every turn, and two common refrains punctuated the talk: “see your CSM for help with this” and “remember, ‘campaign’ has nothing to do with your actual marketing campaign but refers to call treatment” (paraphrased). The latter was mentioned seven times in a short period; clearly it is a response to a problem.</p>
<p>I see “see your CSM for help with this” as an admission; “we know there’s a problem.” This is a sensible thing to say in our current state, and a bad look. “I’m sorry it is broken” is said. “We’re working on it” is not. “Remember, ‘campaigns’ has nothing to do with your actual marketing campaign but refers to call treatment” is also an unwitting admission: “this system wasn’t made for you and it is your problem to remember the odd words it uses.”</p>
<p>What would it take to, say, change “campaigns” to “call treatments?” Would the customers that actually use the term “campaigns” in this way be put out by such a change? Have we asked? Just a thought.</p>
<p>Incoming employees recognize the problem. When I sought feedback for M— recently, D— mentioned “…for the UX team a great emphasis can be made on owning the UX of the platform not just for the new initiatives but for the existing features.” We’d love to, and to do so we need your help and participation.</p>

<li>Quarterly coaching was straightforward and is nearly done. Only one person has not yet submitted their self-eval, and they have a good excuse.</li>
<li>UX is on the critical path of a key project, but not as badly as suspected, and solid progress is being made.</li>
<li>We can chalk some recent process difficulties up to leadership issues, not crew issues. This is fab, because responsibility is squarely placed.</li>
<li>One new mentee relationship and one old one have reminded me of good things to write about; watch this space.</li>
