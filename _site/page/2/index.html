        <p>I fell off the weekly wins wagon <em>hard</em> in November, then wrote just one earlier this month. Time to get back on.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social win – I saw a friend and past coworker who lives in town and it was lovely. I should reach out to more folks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social win – the parents and mother-in-law were in town for the girl's graduation, and brought their attendant challenges, but everything went just fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social win – a different friend and past coworker who lives all the way across the country and I have agreed to chat monthly. No reason not to!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lesson – plan, then check. When I've done just one or the other things have usually gone fine, but not always. This time a stainless steel part about 50mm square ($60 worth of material and cutting) was cut too large and is useless. Turns out it was my fault; all the other parts from the job are fine, I just missed double-checking the dimensions on the one piece. So I need to have that one redone. But the nice people at the fab have agreed to give my reorder special attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership – I was able to take a work maneuver, reasserting focus on the goal, and use it with our HVAC subcontractor. &quot;<em>There's no explanation for water appearing there!</em>&quot; &quot;Ah, but water <strong>is</strong> there, and got there <strong>somehow</strong>, so there <strong>is</strong> an explanation. I don't care whose fault it is, I'd like to know <strong>how</strong> it got there and what we need to do to prevent it now that this has happened.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>Whenever you are on an online or text chat with tech support of any kind, keep a copy of everything you write in a text file. That way you can repeat yourself (as you inevitably will) with minimal effort. As you think of better ways to explain yourself you can update the note.</p>

    <section>
        <p>It's been a bit since I did a &quot;weekly wins&quot; post, mostly because of…lassitude…but with the convenient excuse that we've been finishing the house project and moving and setting up and shepherding the girl through the last bits of high school. So some wins have occurred since the last post, the highest of which have been</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High school is done, with great results. Good grades, an IB diploma, grandparents visiting, relief and happiness and the bittersweet knowledge that for some friendships this might be the last hurrah all in one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're in the house and it is great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We got our full security deposit back with no argument, probably because we cleaned the hell out of the old place. And because the owners are nice. And because since they plan to move in the management company was losing the business anyway and it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have an employee that has gotten some negative feedback; the core of it is old complaints, transmitted up the chain of command and lingering. People not working directly with the employee have formed persistent opinions that aren't accurate. How to extinguish the senior management echo of a problem that's been dealt with? Generate some data – survey the people the employee actually works with to monitor whether or not the positive behaviors in question are witnessed or not. Happily, the employee is taking it seriously, the team members are participating and helpful, and the numbers look good.</p>
</li>
</ul>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Beta is not a release type. Thinking of beta as a release type, essentially a quality level, leads teams to take something not ready for prime time, ship it to everyone, and call it &quot;beta&quot; to excuse its deficiencies. If you are making excuses for the deficiencies of your product you are probably doing it wrong, and it certainly doesn't feel good to do so.</p>
<p>Beta is a testing period. The purpose of beta testing is to take a product that you suspect might be ready for release and expose it to real users that will break it in ways you didn't think to test for. That implies a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These users are testing the product, so you have things you would like them to do to make sure they are exercising the product fully. Therefore you have a testing plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want these users to be active in testing the product, so you have selected them and are actively managing their activity and feedback. Therefore this is not a passive exercise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since you are actively testing the product, you are able to score and count the issues your testers find. The product can prove whether or not it is ready for general release. Therefore you have release criteria. and if you are doing it right you have one or more dates on which you will examine these criteria to determine if the product is ready for release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, since beta is testing, you have a plan, participants, success criteria, and a decision point. If not, you're just trying to hide the fact that you don't care about quality as much as your users will.</p>

        <h1><a href="/_posts/2024/02/11/there-is-no-normal-week-or-day/" rel="bookmark">There is no &quot;normal&quot; week or day</a></h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>At seventeen I joined the staff of a Boy Scout camp, and as an activity area leader I had a role to play in leadership, instruction, and the interactive programming that occurred each week. Each day had something special happening that made the schedule differ from one day to the next, making preparation, instruction, and even rest difficult. With scouts in camp for just a week at a time the strategy to engage them was clearly to make sure there was always a competition, series of skits, cookout, campfire show, ceremony, or recreational extremity (optional, happily: run off the end of the high pier! race to the far rock and back in an overloaded canoe! swim two miles in frigid water!) to draw attention and raise the available hype.</p>
<p>No one day was &quot;normal.&quot; There was no opportunity to settle into a routine, so there was lots of opportunity for scouts, generally between 11 and 16 years of age, to wind up in the wrong place, unsure of where they were supposed to be and how that matched up with what they wanted to be doing, swimming in options and unable to settle into a helpful routine.</p>
<p>It seems the same is true for knowledge workers – above a certain flavor of entry-level position, it's difficult to settle into a daily or weekly routine that would foster comfort in one's competence. It only gets worse as you enter into management or become a senior leader; you are constantly adapting, adjusting, re-focusing, trying and abandoning directions.</p>
<p>I've learned not to lament the lack of routine. This is the job. But I do try to create it for the people I support who need it.</p>
