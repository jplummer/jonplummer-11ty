        <p>Small quality-of-life adjustments can have an amazing effect. Sure, the fact that you need to push on the door a little bit to lock its deadbolt is not a huge deal; it hardly slows you down, takes little effort, and there's nearly no additional wear-and-tear as a result. Not a huge deal <em>once</em>, that is. Eight times a day every day as people come and go, sometimes with full hands or in a hurry, adds up to thousands of exactly-repeated minor annoyances per year with a single cause that is readily fixed. So the value of that fix is quite high, even if each incident is barely noticeable.</p>
<ul>
<li>I adjusted the strike plates on our exterior doors as mentioned above. It's fab! (Ordinarily this would have been done by the contractor, but I put in the strikes so it fell to me.) Therese were not the strikes with the tab with the screwdriver hole, either.</li>
<li>I also some moved boxes and furniture out of the garage, and rearranged some things, so that we can now park one car in the garage. Halfway there!</li>
<li>During that process I started a tool donation box. There are some things that I've bought two or three times, and some things I have that I hope never to use again, and these can go to the tool library. Fish tape, transfer pump, redundant pipe wrench? Sayonara.</li>
<li>Adapting to people being out for summer trips (and to the recent upheaval in priorities) has not been as difficult as I expected, and it has been fun to dive into a little bit of design work to keep things moving for a team who has both designers out.</li>
<li>I had a delightful coffee with a former coworker who is looking for work. We've resolved to meet quarterly.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Work was…fine…this week. Lots of folks are out or about to be out and while there's a moment to try to wrestle projects and processes into shape there are not a lot of people to do that with; preparing projects to to bowl along while they are out is more pressing. But with the girl and the lady out of the house I was productive with home projects. In the last week I've</p>
<ul>
<li>sent a care package</li>
<li>taken care of a library fine by finding and returning the book</li>
<li>bought a copy of that same book, as a gift</li>
<li>set up garage shelves and populated them</li>
<li>moved the last of the boxes and tools from the neighbors' garage</li>
<li>set up a greenhouse (shh, it's a surprise)</li>
<li>reconnected with an old friend</li>
<li>thrilled a nephew with birthday gifts</li>
<li>installed missing trim on a piece of furniture</li>
<li>installed a door stop on the door to the cat litter box area</li>
<li>went to a baseball game</li>
<li>had the tires replaced on a car that sorely needed it</li>
<li>replaced wipers on that same car</li>
<li>replaced antenna garnish on that same car</li>
<li>washed a different car</li>
<li>given myself a haircut</li>
<li>put a hook on the back of the closet door</li>
<li>built a credible trashcan of an unusual size for a specific installation</li>
<li>found and replaced a furnace filter</li>
<li>epoxied together the house numbers and their holding shape</li>
<li>done some emergency laundry</li>
<li>kept all the plants and cats alive</li>
</ul>

        <p>Juneteenth National Independence Day was this last Wednesday. It was odd to have a holiday mid-week but</p>
<ul>
<li>Juneteenth is worth celebrating, worth remembering, worth considering in this political moment.</li>
<li>I forgot that most of our walls are backed by plywood, so a towel bar installation I had put off was unexpectedly quick and dust-free.</li>
<li>The newish head of engineering thanked me for my attention and care to our common (and coming) process fixes.</li>
<li>The notion that we should (and that it makes economic sense to) focus on the things we can do that will help a lot of (and a lot of new) customers is starting to sink in among influential people. The notion that we should (and that it makes economic sense to) work a little harder so that our customers don't have to is taking a little more time, but I think we'll get there.</li>
</ul>

        <p>I fell off the weekly wins wagon <em>hard</em> in November, then wrote just one earlier this month. Time to get back on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social win – I saw a friend and past coworker who lives in town and it was lovely. I should reach out to more folks.</li>
<li>Social win – the parents and mother-in-law were in town for the girl's graduation, and brought their attendant challenges, but everything went just fine.</li>
<li>Social win – a different friend and past coworker who lives all the way across the country and I have agreed to chat monthly. No reason not to!</li>
<li>Lesson – plan, then check. When I've done just one or the other things have usually gone fine, but not always. This time a stainless steel part about 50mm square ($60 worth of material and cutting) was cut too large and is useless. Turns out it was my fault; all the other parts from the job are fine, I just missed double-checking the dimensions on the one piece. So I need to have that one redone. But the nice people at the fab have agreed to give my reorder special attention.</li>
<li>Leadership – I was able to take a work maneuver, reasserting focus on the goal, and use it with our HVAC subcontractor. &quot;<em>There's no explanation for water appearing there!</em>&quot; &quot;Ah, but water <strong>is</strong> there, and got there <strong>somehow</strong>, so there <strong>is</strong> an explanation. I don't care whose fault it is, I'd like to know <strong>how</strong> it got there and what we need to do to prevent it now that this has happened.&quot;</li>
</ul>

        <p>Whenever you are on an online or text chat with tech support of any kind, keep a copy of everything you write in a text file. That way you can repeat yourself (as you inevitably will) with minimal effort. As you think of better ways to explain yourself you can update the note.</p>
