        <p>It took two trips to Home Depot and a barked knuckle, but I repaired a leaky shower handle in less than an hour for $22. This included finding the shutoff for the whole unit and working around others' demands for water. I even managed to notice and fix the hot/cold swap that I inadvertently introduced <strong>before</strong> buttoning everything up. #capabledad #stillgotit</p>
<p>Just a little too late for this project, I also thought that it would be a good idea to write the brand and cartridge part number on the back of the escutcheon to help the next guy. Too bad, next guy!</p>

<li>One-time mentorship conversations are fun, and they remind me how I think about issues. So far everyone has been pleased with our conversations. <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/jon-plummer">https://adplist.org/mentors/jon-plummer</a> I wish I was as readily eloquent when it came to writing these posts.</li>
<li>My knee is much more stable now than it was when it was irritated recently. This is only now that I have PT and ortho referrals coming up, of course. Murphy sometimes mistakenly interferes in a way that makes things a little better.</li>
<li>If you need something done at a hospital, call the patient advocate. Changing the channel from email to phone, and changing the recipient from a barely-interested secretary to a person whose job it is to chase things down has produced enough of my chart from 31 years ago to greatly inform what's to come next, whatever that is. As I say often to the people I support, &quot;f you aren't getting the engagement you want, try changing the channel.&quot;</li>

        <h1><a href="/2023/09/15/pt-asks-how-do-i-convince-leadership-to-care-about-ux-research/" rel="bookmark">PT asks: &quot;how do I convince leadership to care about UX research?&quot;</a></h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>A new mentee opened the session with (paraphrased)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I convince leadership to care about UX research?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a broad question. A giant question. It's highly situational; it's hard to answer without deep knowledge of the organization's goals, its failings, and the people involved.</p>
<p>After a bit of conversation it became clear that the actual question was a little smaller. Paraphrased,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our CTO is placing a lot of emphasis on <em>summative</em> research activities like usability testing. I don't want to neglect, and am more interested in, <em>formative</em> research. How do I convince him to let me do formative research?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, that's still a big question, of the sort that a disinterested third party (me) can't answer directly. But it led us to talk about a few topics:</p>
<h2>1. People have their reasons. What are they?</h2>
<p>The CTO is favoring testing over formative research. Why? They might be right in doing so; maybe that is what the company needs right now. Or they might not understand the value of one or the other. Or they might have a different understanding than you of the proper division of labor in the company. Or…a lot of things could be in play here; people have their reasons. But it'll be hard to influence the CTO or others unless you understand their reasons.</p>
<h2>2. Given the organization's goals and performance, what needs to change?</h2>
<p>What is the company trying to accomplish, and what are their results so far? Does the gap between what they want and what they are achieving (there is almost always a gap) suggest a particular course of action? Is this gap due to poor product/market fit, poor initial quality, churn, cost of support, customer time-to-value, customer payback time, something else? Each of these would suggest different areas of the product to attach and might require different research activities or emphasis.</p>
<h2>3. Who needs to understand the problem the way you do? Who are your allies? Who is your audience?</h2>
<p>Once you understand the CTO's reasons and the organizational situation you can determine if your idea about an intervention (more formative research) is sensible or not – whether or not it will contribute meaningfully to closing the results gap. But then you need to make it happen. And this requires deep knowledge of the organization: the people, the culture, and how change occurs. You may be in an organization where you can, armed with the above information, make a convincing argument to the CTO. You may be in an organization where you have to recruit like-minded people to surround the CTO. Or you may be in a place where convincing the CTO is less important than engaging the people who would be helped more directly by your intervention, the product managers.</p>
<p>We also talked about projects vs incrementalism, chain of command vs lateral influence, and allowing for serendipity in formative research, but those are topics for another time.</p>

        <p>A short week, but things are getting done. People are not waiting, they are seeking. They are asking questions and getting answers. They are not giving even the appearance of waiting. There's <em>bias to action</em>, and then there's <em>bias to learning</em>. These people are doing the latter, and it warms my heart.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UK Gov websites dropping support for alt text fields and giving odd advice about what screen reader users want is making the rounds on Linkedin <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2023/08/10/making-it-easier-to-add-images-on-gov-uk/">https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2023/08/10/making-it-easier-to-add-images-on-gov-uk/</a></p>

<p>Naturally this has been met with many hot takes, including</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bizarre, especially given that i have often heard the uk gov is a good example of taking accessibility seriously</p>
<p>[name redacted 2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if they consulted any screen reader users before they went with this somewhat condescending metaphor: &quot;Another way to make sure you are describing the image properly is to imagine that you're reading out the content of the page on a telephone. When you get to the image, what would you say to help the listener understand the point the page is making?&quot;</p>
<p>[name redacted 3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…as well as complaints that Gov.uk is &quot;canceling the alt tag&quot; and other alarmist conclusions.</p>
<p>Gov.uk's advice is actually pretty good, if a bit high-level.</p>
<p>We <em>should</em> provide alternate content for anything that is not text or cannot be read by a screen reader and that is important to the meaning of the page – for example, if the image were missing or broken the page’s meaning or intelligibility would be diminished – and should <em>not</em> provide alternate content for anything that can be safely left out without diminishing that meaning.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to provide alternate content; the <code>alt</code> attribute is one of them. It appears that <a href="http://gov.uk/">gov.uk</a> is expressing in part that the <code>alt</code> attribute is a less accessible way of presenting that alternate content than simply putting that alternate content right into the page, and that’s true: a person who needs the content in the <code>alt</code> attribute but doesn't use a screen reader (such as a person using a magnifier) will have to do some extra work to dig that content out of the <code>alt</code> attribute that a screen reader user would not need to do. That person would be helped if the alternate content were in the page, and no one else would be inconvenienced by this change.</p>
