    <section>
        <p>Here's a quick one that has saved me time and helped me mask my frustration:</p>
<p>When dealing with a support agent via online chat, keep a copy of everything you type in a separate text file. That way when you think of a better way to explain yourself, or inevitably have to re-explain everything to another agent, you have text at the ready. It's much less work to copy and paste the relevant bits than to write them all again, is less emotionally taxing, and you can look like the nice person you really are, even if this all has gone on far too long.</p>

<li>My eight minute talk wherein I tried to explain/demo the accomplishments of my department over the prior year seemed to go fine. Folks in my department liked it, anyhow.</li>
<li>The gym was closed on Tuesday. No matter – I went for a run. And it was somewhat enjoyable.</li>
<li>A former coworker sent me a very nice message. It made my week!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope you’re doing well! It’s been quite a while since I last spoke to you, and I wanted to say how much I appreciate the impact you have had on my life. I reap the benefits of it almost daily, and I hope to be like you when I grow up.</p>

<li>I blasted through a workout centered on lunges this weekend. This would have been unthinkable a year ago, or even six months ago.</li>
<li>In an attempt to be a little more social I had coffee with local friend Joey. It was very nice.</li>
<li>I'm out of the woods far enough on my coming presentations that my stress level has gone down. Now to practice, polish, and cut.</li>
<li>My adjustments to &quot;find maintenance&quot; with my food intake have, with the help of nutrition coach Christine Imperato, seemingly been successful: I'm now hovering easily at around 200 pounds and know how to stay there at my current activity level. It's a good place from which to try a cut later, as an experiment. It's a good place from which to try lots of things.</li>

<li>I involved the team in figuring out how we would rearrange ourselves now that we have new product priorities, and they came up with what I expect is a good solution without any teeth-gnashing at all.</li>
<li>Conference talk #1 is nearly done, #2 is well-in-hand, and the participatory design exercises are coming along nicely.</li>
<li>I've graduated to weighted pushups, &quot;wearing&quot; a 45lb plate.</li>
<li>While a weights workout still leaves me with a sore knee, these bouts are less painful and last less time than in the past. I'm taking it as a sign that I'm pushing hard at workouts and am happy to give myself a little pat on the back for this.</li>

<li>While the team is sad at the departure of a great employee, they are holding together.</li>
<li>I made less progress than I had hoped on my conference presentation scripts, but more than I was in danger of making, and I'll take that as a win.</li>
<li>I wisely skipped a workout in favor of a friend's birthday party, and it was good to see here and some old friends from a prior job. We fell right in as if we'd never been out. It was nice. I've been &quot;bad at social&quot; for a little while and it is nice to be reminded that I'm not actually bad at social, I'm bad at getting around to asking for and scheduling it.</li>
