<li>Quarterly coaching is done. I might be the first to complete it among the managers.</li>
<li>Our pilot recruiting of prospective research participants (recruit them before you need them) has begun.</li>
<li>I'm hatching a plot to investigate &quot;diving saves&quot; performed by our support team to find and sell revenue-linked usability project to the PM team. In a moment where general experience improvements are met with skepticism, making the effect on the customer of action or inaction really clear is critical. And I have a handful of ideas where to find other such improvement possibilities.</li>
<li>I'm feeling mostly ready for our leadership on-site next week (I guess it's an on-site when remote people come together at HQ?) having written and received helpful comments on many pages of pre-read material. A deadline helps!</li>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>It's common for non-design folks to assume that research and design rigor will slow the overall process down. (I've heard epithets such as &quot;constipate&quot; – unpleasant and rude.) How might the UX team contribute to speed of value delivery?</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving our understanding of our customers (and especially of our users) so that we can make better decisions about direction, scope, interactive details, etc. and especially things <em>not</em> to build. The fastest feature is one you don't build.</li>
<li>Ensuring that every design intervention is a response to a user or customer problem or a benefit that we are sure our customers will value. This is a subset of the above, but deserves special mention because a cool idea is <em>not actually cool</em> unless the person we hope to serve will appreciate the benefit it delivers enough to pay for it.</li>
<li>Answering business questions through small doses (in pharmacology the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose_(pharmacology)">minimum effective dose</a>) of research, concept evaluation, and usability testing.</li>
<li>Helping to manage scope by offering simpler alternatives that users can use to possibly meet seemingly more complicated needs. This is sometimes the opposite of what UX is tempted to do.</li>
<li>Uncovering opportunities to improve usefulness and usability to improve adoption, retention, and time-to-value, which make the business itself faster and more efficient.</li>
<li>Delivering detailed designs, business roles, states, labels, etc. at an appropriate level of fidelity and no fancier, incorporating many elements only by reference to the design system.</li>
<li>Continuously improving the design system so interfaces can be built faster and with greater consistency, and to steadily improve the usability, familiarity, and accessibility of capabilities delivered on the front-end.</li>
</ul>
<p>And everyone should practice <a href="/2023/05/20/active-project-self-management/">active self-management within the project</a>.</p>

    <section>
        <p>I was fielding complaints about slowness in the UX team's contribution to projects until I started talking to the people I support about this concept. Turns out it is good for anyone who works on a team, anyone who works with others.</p>
<p>When starting on or working on a project, I expect everyone to:</p>
<ul>
<li>come to a project with a plan,</li>
<li>share and negotiate that plan, and</li>
<li>be conspicuous in fulfilling that plan, by
<ul>
<li>regularly offering work-in-progress for discussion (there's no such thing as &quot;not ready to look at yet&quot;),</li>
<li>regularly offering the status of current work,</li>
<li>regularly predicting when the current activity will be done,</li>
<li>allowing for the renegotiation of the plan, and</li>
<li>offering modifications to the plan as project or business conditions change (active renegotiation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll note that the default mode here is active – actively planning, actively sharing, actively predicting, actively responding to change.</p>

    <section>
        <p>Last week was tricky motivation-wise; there's an onsite meeting coming up in two weeks that is very important and I'm nervous about the outcome. That's typically a recipe for procrastination. So</p>
<ul>
<li>I got four of five quarterly coaching sessions done (<a href="https://structuredprocrastination.com">structured procrastination</a> for the win).</li>
<li>We started a pilot to recruit prospective research participants; if this works we'll have significantly lowered one of our key barriers to user research. And if not, we can pivot and use the work that went into this pilot in other channels rather than having to start over. Planning your experiments in advance is good.</li>
<li>I got some pre-reads written for the meeting by starting them roughly and sharing prior to their completion. Near as I can tell this is going to produce a better overall result as these docs are already drawing useful comments, and people are aware that they are works-in-progress so there's no expectation that they are perfect expressions of what I think. Share early; it works!</li>
</ul>

        <p>It's time for quarterly coaching, meant to be frequent and light but meaningful. And…</p>
<ul>
<li>…we're ready!</li>
<li>At the moment the folks who have been the steadiest are the hardest to coach and the folks who have had struggles (but are all improving, yay) are the easiest. That's a good sign.</li>
<li>Progress is being made!</li>
