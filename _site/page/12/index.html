        <p>I was fielding complaints about slowness in the UX team's contribution to projects until I started talking to the people I support about this concept. Turns out it is good for anyone who works on a team, anyone who works with others.</p>
<p>When starting on or working on a project, I expect everyone to:</p>
<ul>
<li>come to a project with a plan,</li>
<li>share and negotiate that plan, and</li>
<li>be conspicuous in fulfilling that plan, by
<ul>
<li>regularly offering work-in-progress for discussion (there's no such thing as &quot;not ready to look at yet&quot;),</li>
<li>regularly offering the status of current work,</li>
<li>regularly predicting when the current activity will be done,</li>
<li>allowing for the renegotiation of the plan, and</li>
<li>offering modifications to the plan as project or business conditions change (active renegotiation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll note that the default mode here is active – actively planning, actively sharing, actively predicting, actively responding to change.</p>

        <p>Last week was tricky motivation-wise; there's an onsite meeting coming up in two weeks that is very important and I'm nervous about the outcome. That's typically a recipe for procrastination. So</p>
<ul>
<li>I got four of five quarterly coaching sessions done (<a href="https://structuredprocrastination.com">structured procrastination</a> for the win).</li>
<li>We started a pilot to recruit prospective research participants; if this works we'll have significantly lowered one of our key barriers to user research. And if not, we can pivot and use the work that went into this pilot in other channels rather than having to start over. Planning your experiments in advance is good.</li>
<li>I got some pre-reads written for the meeting by starting them roughly and sharing prior to their completion. Near as I can tell this is going to produce a better overall result as these docs are already drawing useful comments, and people are aware that they are works-in-progress so there's no expectation that they are perfect expressions of what I think. Share early; it works!</li>
</ul>

        <p>It's time for quarterly coaching, meant to be frequent and light but meaningful. And…</p>
<ul>
<li>…we're ready!</li>
<li>At the moment the folks who have been the steadiest are the hardest to coach and the folks who have had struggles (but are all improving, yay) are the easiest. That's a good sign.</li>
<li>Progress is being made!</li>
</ul>

        <ul>
<li>An oft-rescheduled and contentious meeting resulted in a resolution to work together more often and more closely, which is the right answer.</li>
<li>I made progress on (many of) the things this week!</li>
<li>By speaking freely about what I'm working on (for a change) I've found folks who are interested in the results, interested in the process, interested in helping, or who might combine their work and mine to make something even more interesting. Of course! Yet I quickly forget that this is usually the case, especially when I'm feeling sheepish about my progress.</li>
<li>My hygiene and nutrition has been adequate for another trip around the sun. Many happy returns!</li>

        <ul>
<li>Every Thursday I do a ladder of deadlifts – a couple light warmup sets, a handful of medium-heavy work sets, a heavyish couple/few reps, and a couple of legitimately heavy (for me) ones. I go double-overhand as long as I can, switching to a mixed grip once the bar starts to slip out of my hands. That used to happen around the end of the work sets; this week I got all the way to the final &quot;legitimately heavy&quot; set before having to switch grips. Getting better!</li>
<li>I finally managed to schedule some unpleasant diagnostic things I had been avoiding, a volunteer stint at the school district, shoulder PT, and close a lingering needless account by riding the momentum of just getting started. Just chipping off a chunk of a big problem and getting started is an underappreciated skill. (And it's astonishing how deeply broken the US healthcare system is even for someone as healthy as I seem to be.)</li>
<li>The people I support are visibly responding to my coaching. That's a win every time!</li>
</ul>
