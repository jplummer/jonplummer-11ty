    </header>
    <section>
        <p>When receiving feedback on a design or other work the important thing is to see the <em>intent</em> behind the feedback and address that, rather than take the <em>specific</em> advice or try to <em>appease</em> the feedback-giver.</p>
<p>Only by addressing the intent behind the feedback can the work be improved. yes, this might mean taking the specific advice, but it might not. The specific advice may not be the right answer.</p>
<p>Appeasement is waste.</p>

<li>Vacations are winding down and people are starting to come back to work. The team is filling out again.</li>
<li>I convinced the SVP of Product to be quizzed about our product strategy – we'll put a script and some visuals together for our annual Company Connect and hopefully address longstanding complaints that people aren't sure how their work contributes to our strategy. This has raised other interesting topics that might also become topics, like how we really make money and where it goes, how our pricing and packaging works, etc. A lot of the things I was hoping to accomplish this year have been deprioritized (rightly) due to some technical pickles we find ourselves in, so this represents an opportunity to be influential beyond the usual process sand product stuff we do on the reg; fingers crossed.</li>
<li>The ladies are back and the house is no longer empty. This also means my diet will improve – bachelor-mode Jon is (far) less disciplined than husband-mode Jon.</li>

        <p>Small quality-of-life adjustments can have an amazing effect. Sure, the fact that you need to push on the door a little bit to lock its deadbolt is not a huge deal; it hardly slows you down, takes little effort, and there's nearly no additional wear-and-tear as a result. Not a huge deal <em>once</em>, that is. Eight times a day every day as people come and go, sometimes with full hands or in a hurry, adds up to thousands of exactly-repeated minor annoyances per year with a single cause that is readily fixed. So the value of that fix is quite high, even if each incident is barely noticeable.</p>
<ul>
<li>I adjusted the strike plates on our exterior doors as mentioned above. It's fab! (Ordinarily this would have been done by the contractor, but I put in the strikes so it fell to me.) Therese were not the strikes with the tab with the screwdriver hole, either.</li>
<li>I also some moved boxes and furniture out of the garage, and rearranged some things, so that we can now park one car in the garage. Halfway there!</li>
<li>During that process I started a tool donation box. There are some things that I've bought two or three times, and some things I have that I hope never to use again, and these can go to the tool library. Fish tape, transfer pump, redundant pipe wrench? Sayonara.</li>
<li>Adapting to people being out for summer trips (and to the recent upheaval in priorities) has not been as difficult as I expected, and it has been fun to dive into a little bit of design work to keep things moving for a team who has both designers out.</li>
<li>I had a delightful coffee with a former coworker who is looking for work. We've resolved to meet quarterly.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Work was…fine…this week. Lots of folks are out or about to be out and while there's a moment to try to wrestle projects and processes into shape there are not a lot of people to do that with; preparing projects to to bowl along while they are out is more pressing. But with the girl and the lady out of the house I was productive with home projects. In the last week I've</p>
<ul>
<li>sent a care package</li>
<li>taken care of a library fine by finding and returning the book</li>
<li>bought a copy of that same book, as a gift</li>
<li>set up garage shelves and populated them</li>
<li>moved the last of the boxes and tools from the neighbors' garage</li>
<li>set up a greenhouse (shh, it's a surprise)</li>
<li>reconnected with an old friend</li>
<li>thrilled a nephew with birthday gifts</li>
<li>installed missing trim on a piece of furniture</li>
<li>installed a door stop on the door to the cat litter box area</li>
<li>went to a baseball game</li>
<li>had the tires replaced on a car that sorely needed it</li>
<li>replaced wipers on that same car</li>
<li>replaced antenna garnish on that same car</li>
<li>washed a different car</li>
<li>given myself a haircut</li>
<li>put a hook on the back of the closet door</li>
<li>built a credible trashcan of an unusual size for a specific installation</li>
<li>found and replaced a furnace filter</li>
<li>epoxied together the house numbers and their holding shape</li>
<li>done some emergency laundry</li>
<li>kept all the plants and cats alive</li>
</ul>

        <p>Juneteenth National Independence Day was this last Wednesday. It was odd to have a holiday mid-week but</p>
<ul>
<li>Juneteenth is worth celebrating, worth remembering, worth considering in this political moment.</li>
<li>I forgot that most of our walls are backed by plywood, so a towel bar installation I had put off was unexpectedly quick and dust-free.</li>
<li>The newish head of engineering thanked me for my attention and care to our common (and coming) process fixes.</li>
<li>The notion that we should (and that it makes economic sense to) focus on the things we can do that will help a lot of (and a lot of new) customers is starting to sink in among influential people. The notion that we should (and that it makes economic sense to) work a little harder so that our customers don't have to is taking a little more time, but I think we'll get there.</li>
</ul>
