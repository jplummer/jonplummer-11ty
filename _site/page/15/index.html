    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Don't interrupt the user's natural behavior. Enhance or extend the natural behavior, but remain compatible with it.</p>
<p>While I worked for Belkin we made a remote-controllable plug-in switch module. You would plug this thing in to the wall and then plug a lamp or something into it, and it allowed you to control the lamp with your phone, turn it on or off, set a timer, etc. It was great, it sold pretty well, it was totally DIY-able, and pretty understandable. But folks who used it were ultimately lukewarm about it – they didn't love it. It interrupted the natural behavior of turning on and off the lamp. Instead of going to the stem of the lamp you had to either use your phone or push a button on the unit, which was at outlet-level on the wall. If someone turned the lamp off the old-fashioned way you could not use the unit to turn it back on without ALSO turning the lamp on the old way, blunting its usefulness.</p>
<p>A person has thousands of hours of practice turning on and off your lamp in the way it affords. And suddenly they and everyone else in their household needs to stop doing that and do some new, unfamiliar, and potentially awkward thing to just turn the lamp on or off.</p>
<p>Later we sold the same guts in a device that replaced a wall switch. People were much happier with this because there was nothing to get &quot;wrong&quot; – if someone pressed the wall switch to turn the light off, you could still operate it with the phone or as a normal wall switch. It fit naturally into people's existing behavior and enhanced it.</p>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Michael asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you have a variety of potential solutions/designs how do you know which one(s) to choose to iterate on and which ones to discard?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ideal concept is something you can make without too much difficulty, delivers the intended benefit, is intelligible, leaves you open to future improvement, and has a ready way of witnessing success.</p>
<p>Typically you'll be working on a team with (or at least have a high level of contact with) someone in charge of the product (a product manager, usually) and someone in charge of engineering (a software architect or software engineer, usually) – with design this group forms the &quot;product trio.&quot; Each person on the trio has expertise in or evidence for some of the criteria by which you might evaluate concepts. With these in mind the negotiation of which concept (or what parts of which concepts) can begin. For example:</p>
<p><strong>UX</strong> – Is this concept intelligible to users, i.e. do they understand it and believe that it will deliver the desired benefit? Will this concept create a pleasant experience for the people we hope to serve? Does this concept use familiar interaction paradigms? Is this a concept we can build on later or will it need to be scrapped to add functionality? Can we partialize this concept if we need to reduce scope? Will we be able to detect whether or not people are successful in using it (e.g. by counting orders or conversions of some kind, or some other measure of user outcome)? Etc.
<strong>Product</strong> – will this concept deliver the intended benefit? Is this concept strategically relevant? Does the cost/complexity fit our appetite to do the work? Does it seem intelligible to customers (who might be distinct from users)? Can we partialize this concept if we need to reduce scope? Can we add capabilities to this concept to improve it in the future? Will we be able to detect whether or not use of the concept is helping the business (e.g. by counting orders or conversions of some kind, or some other measure of business outcome)? Etc.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong> – is this concept feasible? Does it use data we have available or can get readily? Does it use technology and services we are familiar with or can learn readily? Does the cost/complexity fit our appetite to do the work? Does it lead us into an area we want to develop technically or to strengthen existing capabilities? Etc.</p>
<p>You can see some overlap. For example, the appetite question is PM + Engineering, for example. Customer and user intelligibility is PM + UX. There are others.</p>
<p>In an individual case study lacking these team members you will need to guess at some of these, or at least reveal your thinking about your concept selection.</p>

<li>For the first time in several weeks I did not type &quot;weekly winds.&quot;</li>
<li>Quarterly coaching/reviews are done. Annual merits are done. Things are almost in place for a productive offsite meeting in about a week's time. Everything's coming up Millhouse (except that the product has plenty I'd like to change or fix, not unexpected).</li>
<li>I received good feedback this week from one of the people I support, indirectly through my supervisor. That's nice.</li>
<li>I used a power bar rather than a deadlift bar to deadlift this week, and it was fine. The knurling was more aggressive than my hands prefer, but the weight went up just the same.</li>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>The general idea is that <strong>scope should scale but quality should not</strong>. <a href="/2023/02/02/quality-expectations/">All of these</a> are achievable in small scopes and if we care about quality are not “extra” costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is not usable we will not learn what we hope to learn from an alpha or beta – our learning will be confounded by usability issues.</li>
<li>If it is unpleasant to use, its uptake will be blunted.</li>
<li>If it is not visually credible, confidence in its function will be blunted.</li>
<li>If it contains needless toil its uptake will be blunted.</li>
<li>If it is incomplete in the intended use cases it will seem broken.</li>
<li>If it is incomplete in its states, messages, and errors for the covered use cases it will seem broken.</li>
<li>If it is not obvious it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</li>
<li>If it is not self-explanatory it has poor usability and increases the cost of training, which is backward from what we plan to do.</li>
<li>If it is poorly-labeled it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</li>

        <ul>
<li>The taxes are done. Never mind that the American tax system is needlessly difficult for the vast majority of taxpayers due in part to the political intervention of companies that make money off of this difficulty; the taxes are done.</li>
<li>I have prepared for or delivered four of my five quarterly coaching/reviews. So far, so good.</li>
<li>Another weekend, another dance competition or showcase. The girl did great as a &quot;tall swan&quot; in excerpts from Swan Lake! Lovely to see. And it was nice to stomp around North Bend and Coos Bay for a few hours. One thing you can typically find in maritime towns is old machine shops. No exception here. Fun window-peeping on the weekend!</li>
