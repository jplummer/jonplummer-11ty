        <p>The general idea is that <strong>scope should scale but quality should not</strong>. <a href="/2023/02/02/quality-expectations/">All of these</a> are achievable in small scopes and if we care about quality are not “extra” costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is not usable we will not learn what we hope to learn from an alpha or beta – our learning will be confounded by usability issues.</li>
<li>If it is unpleasant to use, its uptake will be blunted.</li>
<li>If it is not visually credible, confidence in its function will be blunted.</li>
<li>If it contains needless toil its uptake will be blunted.</li>
<li>If it is incomplete in the intended use cases it will seem broken.</li>
<li>If it is incomplete in its states, messages, and errors for the covered use cases it will seem broken.</li>
<li>If it is not obvious it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</li>
<li>If it is not self-explanatory it has poor usability and increases the cost of training, which is backward from what we plan to do.</li>
<li>If it is poorly-labeled it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</li>

<li>The taxes are done. Never mind that the American tax system is needlessly difficult for the vast majority of taxpayers due in part to the political intervention of companies that make money off of this difficulty; the taxes are done.</li>
<li>I have prepared for or delivered four of my five quarterly coaching/reviews. So far, so good.</li>
<li>Another weekend, another dance competition or showcase. The girl did great as a &quot;tall swan&quot; in excerpts from Swan Lake! Lovely to see. And it was nice to stomp around North Bend and Coos Bay for a few hours. One thing you can typically find in maritime towns is old machine shops. No exception here. Fun window-peeping on the weekend!</li>

<li>We've finished emptying our storage unit! That's money that no longer needs to fly out the door each month. And I've repacked several boxes that were collapsing, making it possible to stack better, be more organized, and pass on some things that others will like but that we don't need.</li>
<li>Our landlord found a service that refurbishes old control boards and shipped them the display and relay boards from our oven. The oven display will be working again when he returns on Tuesday.</li>
<li>Better insoles fixed my favorite hiking shoes – no impassioned argument for a return needed.</li>
<li>The girl's dance team won first place at her competition this weekend. Good job, ladies!</li>

<li>My six phase benefit/concept/detail process is going to be piloted in our growth product.</li>
<li>A work relationship that started with a little contention has become a cordial, iron-sharpens-iron collaboration. Tough but fair, I love it.</li>
<li>I've been able to refer or be a reference to three former coworkers in the past two weeks. It's nice to know how you can help.</li>
<li>A couple of weekends ago I chose to do a project for a relative with whom I've had a contentious relationship. This turns out to have been a great choice. I finished the project this weekend; it's nice to feel a sense of accomplishment and to have set a new tone in our relationship, and it cost me only time.</li>

        <p>Just like the <em>false tradeoff</em> between security and usability, I don’t want to play into the notion that light scope and quality are opposing forces. We will not make progress if we habitually shortchange quality. An “MVP” of poor experience quality is certainly “minimum” but forgets the “viable” and a bit of the “product.” You could say it is actually below &quot;minimum.&quot; For another take on this, see Jason Cohen's <a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html">Simple, Lovable, Complete</a>.</p>
