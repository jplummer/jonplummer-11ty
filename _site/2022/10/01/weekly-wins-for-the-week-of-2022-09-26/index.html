<li>I blasted through a workout centered on lunges this weekend. This would have been unthinkable a year ago, or even six months ago.</li>
<li>In an attempt to be a little more social I had coffee with local friend Joey. It was very nice.</li>
<li>I'm out of the woods far enough on my coming presentations that my stress level has gone down. Now to practice, polish, and cut.</li>
<li>My adjustments to &quot;find maintenance&quot; with my food intake have, with the help of nutrition coach Christine Imperato, seemingly been successful: I'm now hovering easily at around 200 pounds and know how to stay there at my current activity level. It's a good place from which to try a cut later, as an experiment. It's a good place from which to try lots of things.</li>
