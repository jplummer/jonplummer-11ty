<li>My practice of doing at least one thing each day for the three topics of network cultivation, opportunities (warm and cold applications, reviewing job boards, targeted networking), and evidence (resume, portfolio, profile, articles) is keeping me moving forward and busy without frazzle.</li>
<li>The fear of doing a poor job on portfolio updates has finally been overwhelmed by the fear of not having done enough. It's a bit tricky as I left one job without gathering visuals and that company no longer exists. It's a bit complicated by the fact that at my prior job nearly all of the team's effort went into rewrites that have not yet shipped, so have not borne results.</li>
<li>Some of my target companies are going through layoffs right now, but there are plenty of other opportunities out there. I just need to keep hammering, and the iron will become hot.</li>
