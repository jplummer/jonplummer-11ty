        <p>An employee who comes to your team via an acquisition</p>
<ul>
<li>was likely in the dark until the acquisition was announced</li>
<li>didn't apply to be part of your company, your team, or for their new job</li>
<li>is accustomed to working on different things, with different people, toward different goals</li>
<li>doesn't know you, or anyone on your team, or your company</li>
<li>is unaware of your expectations of them</li>
<li>experiences a loss of the status they enjoyed as a valued employee prior to the acquisition</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, they are likely very uncomfortable with the situation. And it's really not at all fair; they didn't ask for this to happen. Suddenly they are asked to adapt to a hundred dimensions of unknown.</p>
