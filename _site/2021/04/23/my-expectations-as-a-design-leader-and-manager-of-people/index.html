    <section>
        <h2>Expectations of myself</h2>
<ul>
<li>Foster an ethos of continuous improvement</li>
<li>Repeatedly return to user needs and goals to create alignment</li>
<li>Frame design goals as the marriage of user goals and business wishes</li>
<li>Exhibit genuine care for each person I support</li>
<li>Use wisdom and humor when shaping behavior</li>
<li>Model desired behavior and attitudes for others</li>
<li>Address what's needed wherever it appears</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expectations of designers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scenario-based, goal-oriented</li>
<li>Use storyboards to start understanding a scenario</li>
<li>Freely move between storyboard, workflow, wires, prototype as needed to tackle problems</li>
<li>Make small prototypes to test and learn</li>
<li>The prioritization and arrangement of data directs user attention and action</li>
<li>Organize &quot;done&quot; work into bite-size chunks, set apart from exploratory work</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expectations of all workers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Work to make the job of the next person easier</li>
<li>Work in public, out in the open</li>
<li>Go and see</li>
<li>Be aware of and have your work informed by user goals and business needs together</li>
<li>Create possibilities cheaply, winnow according to goals, improve the best ones</li>
<li>Involve others in solving problems, chewing on possibilities</li>
<li>When presenting possibilities, arrive with your own evaluation of each one – pros and cons, fit to purpose, what you like and don’t like – and the sort of feedback you need</li>
<li>Scope is negotiated – watch for improvements AND for lighter interventions</li>
<li>Experiment with possible improvements to your own and collective work</li>
</ul>
