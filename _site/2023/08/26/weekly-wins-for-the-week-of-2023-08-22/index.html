<li>Quarterly coaching is done! Yay. There were no surprises, as expected. People offered and acknowledged their areas of grown, which is a good sign.</li>
<li>I wrote a <em>screed</em> in the R&amp;D leadership Slack channel and it was well-received. Now I have to help put my complaint into operation; I feel renewed energy for that.</li>
<li>I figured out how to avoid the &quot;vapor lock&quot; many reveal people experience when discussing a vast problem space. It's probably nothing new technique-wise, but already the discussions I'm having are more operationally useful than they were before because we're getting around the temptation to zoom out and hand-wave.</li>
