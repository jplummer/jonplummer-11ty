        <p>My current employer is much like others in that it has a product management process, an engineering process, a design process, a customer onboarding process, a customer support process, etc.</p>
<p>What do you notice? That's right – each discipline group has a separate process. But what is it we are trying to ship?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you turn on a machine, and hammers come out, it's a machine designed to make hammers.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Canada, Harlem Children's Zone (paraphrased from memory)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're trying to ship a problem-solving, efficient, coherent, usable, pleasant, and effective piece of software. So our process, the design of our organization, needs to be arranged such that this is what the machine produces. We're not trying to ship a little bit of engineering, a little bit of design, a little bit of support, and a little bit of product management all shaken up in a bag.</p>
<p>So I don't offer a UX process. I talk about what the product development team needs to do informationally to get from the customer need to the satisfaction of that need. You've heard this before from me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: What benefit do our customers need? What problem are we solving?</li>
<li><strong>Concept</strong>: What concepts can we come up with to deliver that benefit? Which concept should we deliver? How should it work?</li>
<li><strong>Detail</strong>: How should it work specifically? As we work on this are we maintaining or improving usability, intelligibility, functionality, appeal?</li>
<li><strong>In Use</strong>: Are users successful in using it? How might we help them be more successful?</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll note that &quot;In Use&quot; folds right back into &quot;Benefit&quot; and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>The specifics of each informational phase might be organization-specific, but you'll need to harness all of the faculties of the product development organization, including (but not limited to) product management, design, engineering, customers, and users to do a good job in each phase. So this should be a single, integrated process.</p>
