        <p>I forgot that this week ended with Veterans Day. It's awesome to have an unexpected day off, which is really a day to get a handful of other things done. And I did – I closed the to-do list for the day and most of tomorrow, had a lovely lunch with family, and the weekend is just beginning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the confusion and &quot;should&quot;ing at work continues, but we have a leadership offsite coming and this situation has made my agenda clear for that meeting: &quot;what do we mean by quality&quot; and &quot;what am I here to do.&quot; Smaller topics can be set aside for now.</p>
