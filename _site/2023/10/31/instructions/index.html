        <p>The first time I rode a motorcycle I was on the back, clinging to my college roommate. He happened to have a second helmet, it fit well enough, and I was eager to get to the other side of campus.</p>
<p>He gave me two instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Keep your feet on the pegs.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I am not a steering wheel.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you guess which instruction he complained about at the end of the ride?</p>
<p>Here's a hint – it's easier for a not-already-knowledgeable person to follow a positively-worded instruction (do this) than a negatively-worded instruction (don't do that). It's even harder to follow an instruction when it relies on a metaphor, as it's less clear, less obvious, less instructive. The combination of negatively-worded and unclear is worse yet.</p>
<p>I should have asked clarifying questions, like &quot;what would it feel like if I was treating you as a steering wheel?&quot; but I didn't think to at the time.</p>
<p>At work we just did a retro on a somewhat fraught and over-large project, and much of the raw conclusions are negatively-worded. Some are metaphorical. The people involved are knowledgeable but from different disciplines, so the level of shared understanding is probably lower than people guess. So a lot of &quot;don't do X, don't do Y&quot; will probably not get the results we seek. I'll be helping to bend these into positively-worded instructions today. I suspect our success will depend on it.</p>
