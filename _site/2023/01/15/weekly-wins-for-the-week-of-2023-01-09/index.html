        <p>This was meant to be a week in Santa Barbara for work and a little play. A climate-change-strengthened &quot;atmospheric river&quot; made it a week of travel difficulties, muddy torrents, and missed connections. Even so…</p>
<ul>
<li>One-on-one meetings in person, with folks I've only recently met and met only online, went fine. Well, even.</li>
<li>Though we were only able to accomplish about half of our agenda, that half was a good half.</li>
<li>Santa Barbara has good food.</li>
<li>It was interesting to watch, over the course of a few days, our ideas about alternative travel emerge rise and fall in sensibility as conditions changed: roads closed, buses halted, trains canceled, airports shut…ultimately the tie between &quot;take the train&quot; and &quot;rent a car&quot; was decided by Amtrak taking longer to dry the flooded train tracks than CalTrans took to scrape the mud off of the 101. But…</li>
<li>…renting a car allowed us to give a ride to two team members, adding a positive to early disaster.</li>
</ul>
