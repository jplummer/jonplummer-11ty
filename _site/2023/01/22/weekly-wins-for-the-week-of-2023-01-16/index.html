        <ul>
<li>It's downright <em>refreshing</em> to work for a company that doesn't reflexively look to &quot;try harder&quot; as the answer to its problems. It's nice to hear the CEO say that he doesn't think our problem is not stretching enough. (His assertion is that it's alignment we don't have enough of, and that's generally true also.)</li>
<li>Our first design critique (of the &quot;expected, not volunteered&quot; style that I favor) went great. I expect it will continue to go great.</li>
<li>My wife and I have hatched a plan to get our remaining stuff out of storage that does not involve a supreme concentrated effort. Much like how I'd prefer companies make progress on major initiatives, we have a plan to do a little each weekend. This will help us move items, repack the ones that need repacking, and weed out things we no longer want to keep a bit at a time and get out of the storage unit by March. We've already transformed four boxes of books into two boxes to keep and two for the Friends of the Eugene Public Library's annual book sale. The lesson for everyone: you can get a lot done by
<ul>
<li>getting started</li>
<li>taking small bites</li>
<li>regularly</li>
<li>in priority order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
