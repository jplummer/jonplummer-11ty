<li>My six phase benefit/concept/detail process is going to be piloted in our growth product.</li>
<li>A work relationship that started with a little contention has become a cordial, iron-sharpens-iron collaboration. Tough but fair, I love it.</li>
<li>I've been able to refer or be a reference to three former coworkers in the past two weeks. It's nice to know how you can help.</li>
<li>A couple of weekends ago I chose to do a project for a relative with whom I've had a contentious relationship. This turns out to have been a great choice. I finished the project this weekend; it's nice to feel a sense of accomplishment and to have set a new tone in our relationship, and it cost me only time.</li>
