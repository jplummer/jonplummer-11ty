        <ul>
<li>Every Thursday I do a ladder of deadlifts – a couple light warmup sets, a handful of medium-heavy work sets, a heavyish couple/few reps, and a couple of legitimately heavy (for me) ones. I go double-overhand as long as I can, switching to a mixed grip once the bar starts to slip out of my hands. That used to happen around the end of the work sets; this week I got all the way to the final &quot;legitimately heavy&quot; set before having to switch grips. Getting better!</li>
<li>I finally managed to schedule some unpleasant diagnostic things I had been avoiding, a volunteer stint at the school district, shoulder PT, and close a lingering needless account by riding the momentum of just getting started. Just chipping off a chunk of a big problem and getting started is an underappreciated skill. (And it's astonishing how deeply broken the US healthcare system is even for someone as healthy as I seem to be.)</li>
<li>The people I support are visibly responding to my coaching. That's a win every time!</li>
</ul>
