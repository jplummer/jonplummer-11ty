        <p>So many things!</p>
<ul>
<li>Work
<ul>
<li>I promoted someone</li>
<li>I failed to promote someone, but learned a lot and it was the right decision</li>
<li>We've had a couple of leadership offsites and they have been both pleasant and valuable</li>
<li>I've guided my team from AI-skeptic or AI-agnostic to AI-curious, and written a quick position paper to explain our approach to both using AI tools and designing for AI-powered experiences</li>
<li>UX people are strong participants in product trios, at long last</li>
<li>We're hiring!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Home
<ul>
<li>We've caught up on a handful of long-overdue home projects, just in time for the summer heat. Curtains, blinds, gym flooring, patch and paint, more curtains… there's more to do, always, but good progress after a bit of a stall</li>
<li>The ADU is now occupied</li>
<li>The girl is enjoying her six-week ballet intensive in a far-off state</li>
<li>I got my GMRS license. Say hello to WSIX524</li>
<li>Mr. Fixit has branched out into a little light metal work including repairing a watering can and making a house key easier for a blind person to use</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
