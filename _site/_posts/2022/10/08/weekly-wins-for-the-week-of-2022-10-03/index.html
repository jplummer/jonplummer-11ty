<li>My eight minute talk wherein I tried to explain/demo the accomplishments of my department over the prior year seemed to go fine. Folks in my department liked it, anyhow.</li>
<li>The gym was closed on Tuesday. No matter – I went for a run. And it was somewhat enjoyable.</li>
<li>A former coworker sent me a very nice message. It made my week!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope you’re doing well! It’s been quite a while since I last spoke to you, and I wanted to say how much I appreciate the impact you have had on my life. I reap the benefits of it almost daily, and I hope to be like you when I grow up.</p>
