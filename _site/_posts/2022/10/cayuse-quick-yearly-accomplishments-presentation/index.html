<p>In early October I was asked to give an <a href="https://misc.jonplummer.com/portfolio/Quick%20UX%20accomplishments%202022%2010%2005.pptx">eight-to-ten-minute presentation</a> summing up the year for UX. A tall order, but I embraced blazing through the content to alight briefly on things I though the general company audience should know about UX and how we were trying to help.</p>
<p>With most of our work going toward rewrites that have not yet launched thereâ€™s little to say about outcomes, so I followed a rapid tour of our outputs with a couple of quick demos and an invitation to view my upcoming Cayuse Connect Conference talk about <a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/11/02/conference-talk-ux-philosophy/">UX philosophy and practice</a>.</p>
