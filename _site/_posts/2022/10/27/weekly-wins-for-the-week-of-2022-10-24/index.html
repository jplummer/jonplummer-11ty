<p>I got laid off today. That's not a win, surely. But it set off a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>The moment I announced I am #openToWork on LinkedIn there was an inrush of good wishes and referrals and recommendations.</li>
<li>The surviving and departing members of my team spontaneously gathered to provide mutual support. Their comments to each other and to me are really heartening.</li>
<li>I remembered to create an alumni Slack, and some people who left prior to this layoff are showing up. As with the flameout of my previous company, there are good people who formed good relationships and are happy to band together.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, to be honest, it's a bit of a relief.</p>
