<li>My two conference talks went fine. It's not easy to gauge audience response when using some of these online conference platforms, so I'll reserve further judgement until the survey results come in.</li>
<li>One of my online participatory design exercises went fine (the other was marred by low participation). These are hard to do online, but better than nothing, and we learned some things even so.</li>
<li>I tried doing a pull-up on a pair of <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/cannonball-grips">cannonball grips</a>, and surprised myself by succeeding without much trouble. I haven't trained pull-ups for years. Maybe I should. (Word is you should &quot;Spock&quot; your grip on these, with two fingers on either side of the bracket at the top.)</li>
