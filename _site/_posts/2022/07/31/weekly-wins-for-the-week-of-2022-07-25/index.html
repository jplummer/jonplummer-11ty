<p>Three wins for this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>It was less tricky than I feared to come up with four reasonable UX-led programs for the <a href="https://cayuse.com/connect2022/">Connect Conference</a> this October. I'm feeling more optimistic about my (and our) responsibilities for this conference than before.</li>
<li>The nutrition coach pointed out that I'm slightly underfeeding myself with occasional peaks to try to make up for it. Even with those peaks on average I'm a little below where I should be calorie-wise and well-below where I should be protein-wise. That explains why weight and energy have both been proceeding downward and workouts have been getting harder rather than easier. I now have targets that will help me make better choices.</li>
<li>I went for my first run in years, and it wasn't terrible. I went slow, paid attention to duration but not distance or pace, and tried to take it easy on my knee. I used the <a href="https://www.nike.com/nrc-app">Nike Run Club app</a>, since it's free. I'll do this a few more times before making a decision about schedule, shoes, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a little trickier than I expected to find the wins this week.</p>
