        <p>Past Belkin colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterson-d-ryan/">Ryan Peterson</a> recently began posting his &quot;weekly wins&quot; on LinkedIn. My impression is that he did this in part to steel his resolve during is (successful!) job search, and in part to begin a practice of positive self-talk. As he put it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find it easy to be encouraging and optimistic when talking about others. In the past, however, I have struggled to talk to myself in the same positive way.</p>
<p>Ryan Peterson, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterson-d-ryan_weeklywins-carecollaborationcuriosity-activity-6938577436657750016-jKvJ">Weekly Wins #1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But recognizing my own wins doesn’t come easily. We use 15Five at work, and each week are asked &quot;what went well last week?&quot; This is the hardest part of my 15Five check in to fill in. Ryan points out,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I've been struggling to overcome when identifying wins is to allow myself to accept a small win, such as getting lunch with my mom. Also just the practice of taking time to write them down is &quot;forcing&quot; me to be reflective. I'm optimistic that as I continue on this path it will become easier to identify my own wins, and I'll be able to model this for my family at home, and in the workplace.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Accepting a small win may also be a piece of my challenge.</p>
<p>I have already begin thanking others at work as a weekly practice, one I hope comes across as authentic; with this new practice I hope to foster an accurate feeling of regular accomplishment.</p>
<p>So! Three four wins for this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>I witnessed people on my team enthusiastically collaborating and demonstrating gratitude for each other, suggesting that my effort forming a cohesive team is working.</li>
<li>I helped an embattled product time seize the crisis-opportunity created by the diversion of their engineering staff with a solid research plan and a method to capture what they will learn as they prepare for a new take on their product.</li>
<li>I had a lovely meeting with someone in People Operations where I got a sneak peek into our culture survey results, lending credence to insights gained by looking at exit interview data.</li>
<li>I used <a href="https://localwp.com">Local</a> to transform my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6_PXXjU94">slow-as-something-really-slow</a> blog into a speedy static site. I'm not shilling for Local, here; it just seemed like a quick way to make this change.</li>
</ol>
<p>Same time next week?</p>
