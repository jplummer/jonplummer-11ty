<p>Three wins for this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never mind my thoughts about NPS, which I have not written up here but should (edit: See &quot;<a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/07/31/the-trouble-with-nps/">The trouble with NPS</a>&quot;). Our company Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is <strong>five</strong>. Five is not terrible as it's above zero, but it's not something to crow about either. That of my team is <strong>eighty</strong>. If you're curious about eNPS, <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/employee-net-promoter-score-enps-good-measure-engagement/">Qualtrics has an okay writeup</a>. Our engagement scores reflect a similar difference, albeit a bit less grand.</li>
<li>Workouts this week, while at the same weights and only slightly higher volume than last week, were unexpectedly much harder. I did 'em anyhow. This might have something to do with the third win; while I've been losing weight slowly, I've also been losing energy slowly.</li>
<li>I started with a <a href="https://www.triplecrownhealth.com">nutrition coach</a>. I'm in the &quot;write everything down and don't change anything&quot; phase, prior to recommendations. I'm not jazzed about taking progress photos, but I <strong>am</strong> excited about having a knowledgeable person help me steer my habits toward my goal of being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kViCSPXyU8U">above average</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have a good weekend.</p>
