<li>While the team is sad at the departure of a great employee, they are holding together.</li>
<li>I made less progress than I had hoped on my conference presentation scripts, but more than I was in danger of making, and I'll take that as a win.</li>
<li>I wisely skipped a workout in favor of a friend's birthday party, and it was good to see here and some old friends from a prior job. We fell right in as if we'd never been out. It was nice. I've been &quot;bad at social&quot; for a little while and it is nice to be reminded that I'm not actually bad at social, I'm bad at getting around to asking for and scheduling it.</li>
