<li>I accepted the offer and will start December 12. Startup paperwork was mostly easy, save for finding the exact dates of move in/out and start/stop for my address and work histories. Getting a local notary to do my I-9 right took a couple of tries, but it is done, supposedly.</li>
<li>Christmas gifts are almost entirely sewn up. Everything I don't already have in-hand is at least ordered and on the way.</li>
<li>I brought a little bit of interview prep here as an article. It was easy. And since similar articles are an important part of my portfolio in that they are demonstrations of what I bring to a team, I feel I should figure out how to usefully mingle these with more traditional portfolio items. That could take a lot of forms, but I'll turn my advice on myself and
<ul>
<li>Name the problem specifically</li>
<li>Identify the audiences and what I need them to see or learn</li>
<li>Come up with several concepts to address that problem, for those audiences</li>
<li>Select one concept according to its fitness AND feasibility</li>
<li><em>Only then</em> execute that concept, progressively</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
