<p>I accepted the offer and will start December 12. Startup paperwork was mostly easy, save for finding the exact dates of move in/out and start/stop for my address and work histories. Getting a local notary to do my I-9 right took a couple of tries, but it is done, supposedly.</p>

<p>Christmas gifts are almost entirely sewn up. Everything I don't already have in-hand is at least ordered and on the way.</p>

<p>I brought a little bit of interview prep here as an article. It was easy. And since similar articles are an important part of my portfolio in that they are demonstrations of what I bring to a team, I feel I should figure out how to usefully mingle these with more traditional portfolio items. That could take a lot of forms, but I'll turn my advice on myself and</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name the problem specifically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the audiences and what I need them to see or learn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come up with several concepts to address that problem, for those audiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select one concept according to its fitness AND feasibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Only then</em> execute that concept, progressively</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
