<p>Three wins:</p>
<ul>
<li>While a respected and very productive design contractor gave notice, she had a lot of nice things to say about the team, company, and my management of the team. I'm sorry to see her go, but I feel pretty good about what I've been doing.</li>
<li>I had a great workout on Tuesday, but that night thought maybe I had injured myself. I had pushed hard, and while I felt good right after the workout about ninety minutes later I had knee pain, enough to have difficulty sleeping. But whatever it was dissipated very quickly, and by Thursday I was ready and able to have another great workout. I'm cautious, but expecting that this weekend things will be even better. A happy side effect is that I regained a little bit more knee flexion range than I expected.</li>
<li>I managed to work some bonus content into my presentation about NPS results, relating complaints in NPS comments to a similar signal in support tickets. I also completed that presentation a little sooner than I had planned. I haven't presented yet, but I'm optimistic. I feel good about what I'm about to do.</li>
</ul>
