<p>A recent correspondent asked how to move his team from &quot;thoughts and fears about plans&quot; to action, and I suggestion making their next intervention a <em>pilot</em>. That way an intervention is an <em>experiment</em>, and can be evaluated, then continued, tweaked, or ended.</p>
<p>I counseled him to consider coaching folks to articulate</p>
<ul>
<li>the problem we see</li>
<li>the result we want</li>
<li>what we'll try, for how long</li>
<li>how we will know if it is working or not</li>
<li>how we will know if we should stop the pilot early</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the pilot you can evaluate the results and decide to</p>
<ul>
<li>continue as-is</li>
<li>continue with tweaks</li>
<li>try something else</li>
<li>stop altogether</li>
</ul>
<p>with the same five points above for any change or new intervention.</p>
