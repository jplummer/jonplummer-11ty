<p>Last week I pointed out that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The moment I announced I am #openToWork on LinkedIn there was an inrush of good wishes and referrals and recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the past week I've noticed the stream of well-wishers, recommenders, and referrers continue. This reminds me that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have a bigger and better network than I give myself credit for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of those relationships have been surprisingly resilient (as I've not been the best about keeping in touch in most cases)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people who have been recommending me have been recommending me for largely the same traits and activities. So these traits are real, and I can use this fact to let impostor syndrome calm down a little bit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a second flood has begun â€“ little tidbits that would be useful fodder for this blog or LinkedIn posts are becoming more apparent to me, and more often. I'm still wrestling with the &quot;what does the portfolio of a director look like&quot; issue, but I hope to have that sorted out soon, and I bet it will involve talking about how to get the work done more than the work itself..</p>
