<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>A small incident today reminds me of the importance of explaining not just <em>what</em> action you'd like taken but <em>why</em>. I have found this to be true so often that it's become part of how I usually communicate with coworkers, supervisors, even my own family.</p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>The message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need either a new sewer outlet hose and a carrier to match, or just a new sewer outlet hose. Would prefer a longer hose and the ability to carry it. If using the existing carrier, there's a bolt missing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>became, through the telephone game</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longer sewer outlet hose with carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the work done merely</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Replaced two missing screws from carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with the note</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently has 47&quot; hose carrier, only has max 62&quot; space for different carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>missing the (completely accomplishable) goal entirely.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In August we took our little Airstream on a two-week trip from Oregon to Navajo country then back through some of the national parks of northern Arizona and southern Utah. It was an amazing trip, but we had a variety of mishaps with the trailer along the way. High winds carried off our radio antenna, we struggled with a blockage in the sewage tank, the toilet valve started to leak (not in a gross way), we lost a rivet inside, the awning started to spring back sluggishly and then not at all, we blew out a backflow preventer leading to a flood of fresh water coming out from behind the kitchen cabinet, etc. And in the very last days of the trip our 12-year-old sewer hose finally started to crack, leading to a small but unpleasant situation when we went to dump our waste water.</p>
<p>Naturally, once we arrived home we cleaned things up as best we could and made an appointment with our local service provider. Once I started to explain our list of issues they smartly asked me to email the list, which I did, explained in detail.</p>
<p>The drop off day arrived, and I dutifully explained each issue to the service writer, who had prepared a repair order based on the email. The service writer said he thought my explanations, email, and the repair order all made sense, and I handed him the keys.</p>
<p>Weeks passed, and I received a call saying the repairs were complete. We made an appointment for me to pick up the trailer.</p>
<h2>That brings us to today</h2>
<p>Today was pick up day, but I returned home empty-handed. All of the repairs were done satisfactorily but one: I had neither a new sewer hose nor a carrier to match. All that was done was to replace screws needed to hold the existing carrier in place.</p>
<p>Looking over the repair order, line two had only the instructions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longer sewer outlet hose with carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those aren't bad instructions, actually. If they had been fulfilled, I'd have taken the trailer home. Instead, the trailer still had the original hose and carrier.</p>
<p>Apparently the next size hose carrier is 64 inches long (162.5 science units) and there was only 62 inches of unobstructed space across the trailer to install a carrier, so the technician spotted and fixed what they could see as wrong, missing screws. They took a note to this effect</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently has 47&quot; hose carrier, only has max 62&quot; space for different carrier. Replaced two missing screws from carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and stopped work. The effect of this is that the most important part of my problem, needing a new sewer hose, was not remedied, and the least important, this too-short hose carrier being loose, was all that was worked on.</p>
<h2>What went wrong?</h2>
<p>I can think of a handful of different things that someone could have done to improve the situation. But the most charitable interpretation is that my goal</p>
<blockquote>
<p>new sewer outlet hose and a carrier to match, or just a new sewer outlet hose</p>
</blockquote>
<p>didn't make it to the technician. I probably have a hand in that miss, as does the service writer.</p>
<p>There also might be a little bit of <em><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/2012-09-07/ty-article/word-of-the-day-rosh-gadol/0000017f-e66d-dc7e-adff-f6ed883b0000">rosh gadol</a></em> at work here; come to find out also that I'm not stuck with my too-short 47 inch carrier or a too-long 64 inch carrier â€“ there are adjustable hose carriers. And surely a technician can select a carrier, adjust it to a suitable length, test a new hose to see if it will fit, and finding a match install both and sell them to me.</p>
<p>(It also probably did not help that my expression of the goal included an &quot;or.&quot;)</p>
<h2>The remedy</h2>
<p>Today I told the service writer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My goal is to have a new sewer hose, and the means to carry it, installed on the trailer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exact manner of meeting that goal is open to interpretation, but if that goal makes it to the technician this time I'm confident I will have the result I seek.</p>
