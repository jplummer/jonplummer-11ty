<p>Gentle people,</p>
<p>It's a moment of uncertainty and anxiety (election), piled atop a lengthy period of uncertainty and anxiety (pandemic, police killings, climate change, fires, etc.) with no real end in sight. I get it if you're distracted. It's fine—expected, even.</p>
<p>Be kind to yourself. And if you like, let me be kind to you, too. Let me know if you need help. Need to clear the decks? I can help. Need things to do to be distracted? I can help. Need to get something off your chest? I can help.</p>
<p>Don't want to talk about it? Fine. Want to talk about it? Fine. I'm here for that, either way.</p>
<p>We will gratefully greet the sun in the morning.</p>
