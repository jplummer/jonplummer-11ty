<p>I was fielding complaints about slowness in the UX team's contribution to projects until I started talking to the people I support about this concept. Turns out it is good for anyone who works on a team, anyone who works with others.</p>
<p>When starting on or working on a project, I expect everyone to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>come to a project with a plan,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>share and negotiate that plan, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be conspicuous in fulfilling that plan, by</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>regularly offering work-in-progress for discussion (there's no such thing as &quot;not ready to look at yet&quot;),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly offering the status of current work,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly predicting when the current activity will be done,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allowing for the renegotiation of the plan, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>offering modifications to the plan as project or business conditions change (active renegotiation).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll note that the default mode here is active â€“ actively planning, actively sharing, actively predicting, actively responding to change.</p>
