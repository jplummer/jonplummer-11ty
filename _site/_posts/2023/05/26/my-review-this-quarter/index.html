        <p>I've shared this verbatim with my team and pointed out how it will affect our work in the coming quarter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon has done a great job ramping up on all things Invoca and focusing on building out the UX discipline and helping push us to be more customer centric.</p>
<p>Jon has balanced time improving processes/personnel within the UX group (for ex: instituting the weekly design critique meeting) and helping create the right conditions for UX to succeed with key stakeholders (primarily PM &amp; ENG leadership). I believe this overall area should continue to be Jon's Q2 focus while begining to take steps to evangelize and show off results of UX output to stakeholders. We discussed a few ideas such as Trios sharing/demoing their work in settings like Invocation, CKO, Company Connect. Jon &amp; team have also started using Lattice to publicly praise good work in Slack.</p>
<p>Other candidates for UX growth discussed:<br>
* Building out UX personas/profiles under 'business centers' - to be used both in product development and by the organization to be more customer-centric and raise the visibility of UX.<br>
* Building muscles as a trio and working projects in scoped iterations en route to GA vs. larger chunks shipped.<br>
* Removing barriers or reliance on PM/others for UX to get more direct interaction with customers; having UX lead respective customer sessions (and bringing insights back to the teams) vs. being in the passenger seat.<br>
* Jon &amp; team potentially spending more time learning the product in conjunction with projects and their focus areas in the platform.</p>
<p>I also want to call out the good work Jon has done building trust and goodwill with the 'First Team' in R&amp;D. I hope we can continue to focus on problems and improvement areas collectively (being open to sharing in the leadership Slack channel, etc) and use 1:1 discussions as warranted vs. the way to solve problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty good?</p>
