<p>It took two trips to Home Depot and a barked knuckle, but I repaired a leaky shower handle in less than an hour for $22. This included finding the shutoff for the whole unit and working around others' demands for water. I even managed to notice and fix the hot/cold swap that I inadvertently introduced <strong>before</strong> buttoning everything up. #capabledad #stillgotit</p>
<p>Just a little too late for this project, I also thought that it would be a good idea to write the brand and cartridge part number on the back of the escutcheon to help the next guy. Too bad, next guy!</p>
