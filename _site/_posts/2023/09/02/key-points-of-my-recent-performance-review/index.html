        <p>(Quotations are my words, all else are the words of my manager.)</p>
<h2>Revision to goals for the quarter</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Step into responsiveness via the design system – propose to R&amp;D why and a way forward to get us to accommodate actual user viewport sizes better, and get a resulting project onto the roadmap</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't have the strongest opinion on this one and bucket it similarly to chipping away at general UX improvements. I don't want to dig the hole deeper – anything net new we develop would ideally have a higher bar of usability prior to general release – but would need to see specific examples with LOE of more general improvement candidates to weigh in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improve the quality of UX delivery – establish Figma delivery conventions specifically intended to reduce the cognitive load on developers, with developer input and feedback, and pilot these new conventions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strongly agree with this one and I appreciate how Jon scoped the specific action item this quarter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advocate for an appropriate level of UX/UI polish to survive engineering delivery by spreading the UX review cycle currently piloted via Smart Alerts and Call Review projects to other teams/crews</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also in strong agreement here but with the most Q3 emphasis being on Call Review &amp; Coaching-related projects if we had to prioritize where Jon spends his time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advocate for and begin a project to do POC IAs for various user types to explore the sensibility and difficulty of separating [product A] and [product B]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We talked about modifying this one a bit as some of the groundwork on [product B] is in place. I let Jon know that I have a Q3 goal with [PM] to revamp the [product A] product vision/strategy which will surely need UX input as stakeholders and that ideally better defines where UX output can be helpful for [product A] future IA and candidates for usability improvement.​</p>
<h2>Values</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Light The Customer's Way</strong>: [evident in] the improvements we've made to UX quality in recent releases and stronger focus on customer adoption and usability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: Jon's involvement in many of the organizational &amp; process improvements we've rolled out in recent months, ensuring UX had a seat at the table ahead of making these changes and providing his perspective that influenced the solutions we implemented.​</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Past Quarter's Results</h2>
<p>Jon has done a fantastic job improving both the quality of UX output at Invoca and building buy-in for user/customer-centric activities. He receives positive feedback from cross-department stakeholders and I am grateful to have him leading UX efforts. Key examples of Jon's leveling up of UX in recent months:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>His participation at Dallas and May offsites, particularly the lead up to our leadership offsite and his help with material preparation and follow through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His very well-received Connect talk that summarized/connected the dots on many of the changes we had been looking to drive following our offsite discussions - trios, experimentation, shipping value/quality vs. speed, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveling up members on the UX team and helping define new shaping frameworks to set them up for success. Also, pushing the team to have more direct customer/user feedback sessions.I hope Jon recognizes how far we've come in a short time (no longer prioritizing by service area vs. customer needs) and I'm excited to continue the journey with him.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>​2 – Right On Track</p>
