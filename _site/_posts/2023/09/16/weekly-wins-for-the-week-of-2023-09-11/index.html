<li>One-time mentorship conversations are fun, and they remind me how I think about issues. So far everyone has been pleased with our conversations. <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/jon-plummer">https://adplist.org/mentors/jon-plummer</a> I wish I was as readily eloquent when it came to writing these posts.</li>
<li>My knee is much more stable now than it was when it was irritated recently. This is only now that I have PT and ortho referrals coming up, of course. Murphy sometimes mistakenly interferes in a way that makes things a little better.</li>
<li>If you need something done at a hospital, call the patient advocate. Changing the channel from email to phone, and changing the recipient from a barely-interested secretary to a person whose job it is to chase things down has produced enough of my chart from 31 years ago to greatly inform what's to come next, whatever that is. As I say often to the people I support, &quot;f you aren't getting the engagement you want, try changing the channel.&quot;</li>
