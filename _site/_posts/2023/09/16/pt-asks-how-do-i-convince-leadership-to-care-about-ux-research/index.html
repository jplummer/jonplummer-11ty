        <p>A new mentee opened the session with (paraphrased)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I convince leadership to care about UX research?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a broad question. A giant question. It's highly situational; it's hard to answer without deep knowledge of the organization's goals, its failings, and the people involved.</p>
<p>After a bit of conversation it became clear that the actual question was a little smaller. Paraphrased,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our CTO is placing a lot of emphasis on <em>summative</em> research activities like usability testing. I don't want to neglect, and am more interested in, <em>formative</em> research. How do I convince him to let me do formative research?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, that's still a big question, of the sort that a disinterested third party (me) can't answer directly. But it led us to talk about a few topics:</p>
<h2>1. People have their reasons. What are they?</h2>
<p>The CTO is favoring testing over formative research. Why? They might be right in doing so; maybe that is what the company needs right now. Or they might not understand the value of one or the other. Or they might have a different understanding than you of the proper division of labor in the company. Or…a lot of things could be in play here; people have their reasons. But it'll be hard to influence the CTO or others unless you understand their reasons.</p>
<h2>2. Given the organization's goals and performance, what needs to change?</h2>
<p>What is the company trying to accomplish, and what are their results so far? Does the gap between what they want and what they are achieving (there is almost always a gap) suggest a particular course of action? Is this gap due to poor product/market fit, poor initial quality, churn, cost of support, customer time-to-value, customer payback time, something else? Each of these would suggest different areas of the product to attach and might require different research activities or emphasis.</p>
<h2>3. Who needs to understand the problem the way you do? Who are your allies? Who is your audience?</h2>
<p>Once you understand the CTO's reasons and the organizational situation you can determine if your idea about an intervention (more formative research) is sensible or not – whether or not it will contribute meaningfully to closing the results gap. But then you need to make it happen. And this requires deep knowledge of the organization: the people, the culture, and how change occurs. You may be in an organization where you can, armed with the above information, make a convincing argument to the CTO. You may be in an organization where you have to recruit like-minded people to surround the CTO. Or you may be in a place where convincing the CTO is less important than engaging the people who would be helped more directly by your intervention, the product managers.</p>
<p>We also talked about projects vs incrementalism, chain of command vs lateral influence, and allowing for serendipity in formative research, but those are topics for another time.</p>
