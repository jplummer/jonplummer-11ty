<p>Good Friday Spring Holiday â€“ this day off caught many at work by pleasant surprise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A chat with the SVP of Engineering reminded me that I'm overdue on publicizing and gathering support for the high-level version of my plan for the department. My goal for the week is set!</p>

<p>While Swift syntax is distinctly weird to my &quot;C-like&quot; early Javascrip-trained eyes, plowing through the Apple-provided tutorials is helpful. Somewhat. Even so, the use/placement of dots in something like the following is distinctly odd to me:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>VStack() {
	Image(systemName: &quot;pin&quot;)
		.imageScale(.large)
		.foregroundColor(.accentColor)
	Text(&quot;Placeholder text for now&quot;)
}
.padding()
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, I'm team tabs.</p>
