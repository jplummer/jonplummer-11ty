<p>I' need'll start to keep track of wins as they happen; trying to remember all that happened last week is not easy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My &quot;plan&quot; has been reviewed by my team and my boss without much objection – time to double-check it for intelligibility and broaden the audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One conclusion of discussion last week is that there's widespread disagreement about how well we understand our users. This leads me to believe that the real answer is &quot;not very well.&quot; This is a win in that it makes they way forward much clearer. (There might also be some confusion around users versus customers here.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My boss' team meeting is about to get a lot spicier – he'll have some news as usual, but we're all expected to bring statuses (though <strong>not statusing</strong> (future article)!) and discussion topics. I'm full of that stuff, and it'll be good to have the opportunity to <strong>display accountability</strong> (future article).</p>
</li>
</ul>
