<p>I had a medical…thing…to do on Monday so this was another shortish week, the sort where all the meetings get slid atop one another to occupy available space so you can pretend that it was not a short week. Even so,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The medical thing went fine. I remember nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friday was meeting-light so I got a little bit of non-meeting work done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I realized that for a handful of the initiatives I'm on I needn't toil in obscurity but would do better to send async questions to a handful of people, so I did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A team-wide message from the CEO mentioned &quot;The transition to a multi-product company, the importance of AI, and strengthening the role of UX and front end engineering have emerged more clearly for me as priorities.&quot; – It's sinking in!</p>
</li>
</ul>
