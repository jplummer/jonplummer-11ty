<p>Be it version three or an MVP, the experience we deliver should</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>be valuable to specific users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be usable by those users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>conform to or enhance the user's understanding of the subject area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be pleasant to use</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>minimize toil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be complete in its delivery of the uses we offer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be complete in its states, messages, and errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make good use of familiar controls and interaction paradigms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make success obvious</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>â€¦even if the scope is small, even if it's a little slice of functionality from a bigger, longer-term plan, even if it is a fragment of the excellent future we envision. Even the basics should be built completely, with thoughtfulness and pride.</p>
