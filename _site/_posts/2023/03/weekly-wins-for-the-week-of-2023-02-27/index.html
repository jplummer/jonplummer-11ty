<li>
<p>For the first time in several weeks I did not type &quot;weekly winds.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quarterly coaching/reviews are done. Annual merits are done. Things are almost in place for a productive offsite meeting in about a week's time. Everything's coming up Millhouse (except that the product has plenty I'd like to change or fix, not unexpected).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I received good feedback this week from one of the people I support, indirectly through my supervisor. That's nice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used a power bar rather than a deadlift bar to deadlift this week, and it was fine. The knurling was more aggressive than my hands prefer, but the weight went up just the same.</p>
