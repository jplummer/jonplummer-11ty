<p>Last week was all about an off-site meeting involving the product and engineering groups.</p>
<p>(What does off-site mean in today's remote-first environment? Never mind.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It was a good set of sessions! in particular, the hackathon presentations were funny and inspiring. Enough so that I'm tempted to get back into coding a little. Maybe I could hack(athon) a bit one day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My team really came together working on our &quot;elevator-pitch-style&quot; team charter. I have some homework to do to set us up for the last step, but it's a pleasure to collect the good thoughts of good people trying hard to improve.</p>

<p>A coworker made their displeasure with the past UX regime abundantly clear in a group setting, and I decided I would not let it bother me. Even so, it did, for a bit. But later when we talked about it and I <strong>told them</strong> I had decided not to let it bother me, it <strong>actually</strong> no longer bothered me. It worked!</p>
</li>
</ul>
