<p>I'm light on wins this week. The most challenging part of posting wins each week is being conscious of them!</p>

<p>I wrote two blog posts this week, and without waiting for the weekend. I find that I'll write a little explainer for someone in the normal course of business, mentoring, etc. and realize that it would make a pretty good short post. (This might be my main source of content.)</p>

<p>I've an idea for another quick post re the favorite topic these days: ChatGPT. People's un-ironic embrace of ChatGPT as a substitute for actually doing the work yourself is understandable but alarming. It's going to cause us to look at people's work a bit differently for a while. (Actually, an idea is only a win of you execute on it, because <a href="https://www.quotes.net/mquote/848858">ideas are cheap</a>.)</p>
