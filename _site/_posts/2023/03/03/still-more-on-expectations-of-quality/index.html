<p>The general idea is that <strong>scope should scale but quality should not</strong>. <a href="https://jonplummer.local/2023/02/02/quality-expectations/">All of these</a> are achievable in small scopes and if we care about quality are not “extra” costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it is not usable we will not learn what we hope to learn from an alpha or beta – our learning will be confounded by usability issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is unpleasant to use, its uptake will be blunted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is not visually credible, confidence in its function will be blunted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it contains needless toil its uptake will be blunted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is incomplete in the intended use cases it will seem broken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is incomplete in its states, messages, and errors for the covered use cases it will seem broken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is not obvious it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is not self-explanatory it has poor usability and increases the cost of training, which is backward from what we plan to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is poorly-labeled it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
