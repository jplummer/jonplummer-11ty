        <p>It seems like we have a pretty good grasp of what quality should be when it comes to infrastructure – what technical soundness is, how much load we should handle, what kind of logging, etc. but we are less mature regarding other dimensions of quality.</p>
<p>An interactive item in general availability, operated by customer users, should</p>
<ul>
<li>be valuable to specific users
<ul>
<li>deliver value in results and conveniences</li>
<li>minimize toil</li>
<li>and this should be verifiable by experiment and by monitoring success metrics/adoption rate/etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be usable by those users
<ul>
<li>intelligible
<ul>
<li>and this should be made more likely via concept testing, and somewhat verifiable by experiment and by monitoring success metrics/adoption rate/etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>obvious in expected actions and right action (design guideline)</li>
<li>makes success obvious (design guideline)</li>
<li>makes good use of familiar controls and interaction paradigms where possible (design guideline)</li>
<li>and this should be made more likely through user testing, and monitorable via success rate/time on task/error rate/etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be complete in its states, messages, and errors (design guideline)</li>
<li>be instrumented so we can witness users’ successes and difficulties</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s some disagreement about how important interactive quality might be for infrequently-operated configuration tasks in the platform. The irony is that an infrequently-operated item is not practiced frequently enough by a user to be well-learned, so it must be <em>more</em> obvious in its operation than something they do every day. So to the above there’s pressure to add</p>
<ul>
<li>be self-explanatory, relying on recognition rather than training and recall</li>
</ul>
<p>For products in a growth phase, where catering to new users and bringing them to intermediate proficiency is arguably more important than catering to existing power users, “be self-explanatory, relying on recognition rather than training and recall” is also important for the most critical, central workflows.</p>
<p>Some attention to interactive quality is important even in experiments, since poor interactive quality can confound our measurements. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is not usable we may not learn what we hope to learn from an experiment or a beta – since actual use will be hampered.</li>
<li>If it is unpleasant to use, its uptake will be blunted unless the value strongly outweighs the problems.</li>
<li>If it is not visually credible, confidence in its function will be blunted.</li>
<li>If it contains needless toil it will be unpleasant, time on task will be high, error rate may be high.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some confounding factors inhere more strongly to “complete” features rather than experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is incomplete in the intended use cases it will seem broken.</li>
<li>If it is incomplete in its states, messages, and errors for the covered use cases it will seem broken.</li>
<li>If it is not obvious it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</li>
<li>If it is not self-explanatory it has poor usability and increases the cost of training, which is backward from what we plan to do.</li>
<li>If it is poorly-labeled it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general idea is that scope should scale but quality should not. All of these are achievable in small scopes and if we care about quality are not “extra” costs.</p>
