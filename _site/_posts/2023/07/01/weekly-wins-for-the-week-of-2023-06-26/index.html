<p>Scattered wins this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After three tries (all administrative or preparation missteps of one sort or another) the girl now has a learner's permit; a small but crucial step toward learning a few adult skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disconcert between two teams is giving way to eagerness and collaboration. Three things I often talk about are helping us along:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>referring to real customer data,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>finding and negotiating common goals, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>humans remembering to relate to one another.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of the people I support are getting the message that attention to detail must be demonstrated. (In the details! Surprise.) This has required some tight feedback loops, but I think I'm successfully avoiding micromanaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mentorship is fun! I might have a new mentee, perhaps just for the duration of their job search.</p>
</li>
</ul>
