<p>As of nine weeks ago I have a new job at Cayuse. But how do I explain my accomplishments on LinkedIn when I'm so new?</p>
<p>Maybe I don't. What if I instead explain what I am there to do? What would that be like?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am building a design and research team to support the collection of 25+ disparate built and acquired products into a single coherent suite. Since I've recently begun, here's what I plan to accomplish:<br>
• Develop UX and UI design capacity and capability<br>
• Add and develop UX research capability<br>
• Install formative usability testing during design to de-risk detailed design decisions<br>
• Install user insights research, concept design and validation<br>
• Stand up a team and processes to build and improve a design system in visuals and code, for the product suite<br>
• Gather and improve product personas to be an informative smaller set of personas for the entire suite<br>
• Begin instrumentation of new features, to measure outcomes, by determining desired outcomes at the epic level<br>
• Help the product team take advantage of existing pre-customer and post-launch data, such as customer success contact data, support forum and knowledge base behavior, RFP mining, sales demo feedback, etc.</p>

<p>I suppose over time I could exchange some of these for my accomplishments and my new plan. I've not seen this anywhere else. Good idea? Bad idea?</p>
