<p>Heather asked me yesterday &quot;who owns accessibility?&quot; That's a fun question. I replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accessibility is not owned. Who owns quality? It's a team responsibility. To the extent that accessibility compliance, or release date, or the P&amp;L is a &quot;feature&quot; of a piece of software it is owned by the PM, but each function has its responsibilities in accomplishing accessibility. Making these responsibilities explicit is necessary.</p>
<p>The folks with responsibilities mainly include UX (designing for accessibility), FED (engineering for accessibility), QA (inspection), and PM/PO (prioritization). These aren't collected in one person's purview around here until the CEO, so that's not the answer to your question.</p>
<p>If we are to be product-led and not sales-led, PM has to insist on it (and manage competing priorities), maybe that's part of the answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;ownership&quot; urge seems to sometimes dilute or deprioritize the responsibilities of others, which is a shame because we must work in concert.</p>
