<p>Small quality-of-life adjustments can have an amazing effect. Sure, the fact that you need to push on the door a little bit to lock its deadbolt is not a huge deal; it hardly slows you down, takes little effort, and there's nearly no additional wear-and-tear as a result.

<p>Adapting to people being out for summer trips (and to the recent upheaval in priorities) has not been as difficult as I expected, and it has been fun to dive into a little bit of design work to keep things moving for a team who has both designers out.</p>

<p>I had a delightful coffee with a former coworker who is looking for work. We've resolved to meet quarterly.</p>
