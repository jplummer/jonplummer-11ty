        <p>It's been a bit since I did a &quot;weekly wins&quot; post, mostly because of…lassitude…but with the convenient excuse that we've been finishing the house project and moving and setting up and shepherding the girl through the last bits of high school. So some wins have occurred since the last post, the highest of which have been</p>

<p>I have an employee that has gotten some negative feedback; the core of it is old complaints, transmitted up the chain of command and lingering. People not working directly with the employee have formed persistent opinions that aren't accurate. How to extinguish the senior management echo of a problem that's been dealt with? Generate some data – survey the people the employee actually works with to monitor whether or not the positive behaviors in question are witnessed or not. Happily, the employee is taking it seriously, the team members are participating and helpful, and the numbers look good.</p>
</li>
</ul>
