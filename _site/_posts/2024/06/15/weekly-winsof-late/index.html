        <p>I fell off the weekly wins wagon <em>hard</em> in November, then wrote just one earlier this month. Time to get back on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social win – I saw a friend and past coworker who lives in town and it was lovely. I should reach out to more folks.</li>
<li>Social win – the parents and mother-in-law were in town for the girl's graduation, and brought their attendant challenges, but everything went just fine.</li>
<li>Social win – a different friend and past coworker who lives all the way across the country and I have agreed to chat monthly. No reason not to!</li>
<li>Lesson – plan, then check. When I've done just one or the other things have usually gone fine, but not always. This time a stainless steel part about 50mm square ($60 worth of material and cutting) was cut too large and is useless. Turns out it was my fault; all the other parts from the job are fine, I just missed double-checking the dimensions on the one piece. So I need to have that one redone. But the nice people at the fab have agreed to give my reorder special attention.</li>
<li>Leadership – I was able to take a work maneuver, reasserting focus on the goal, and use it with our HVAC subcontractor. &quot;<em>There's no explanation for water appearing there!</em>&quot; &quot;Ah, but water <strong>is</strong> there, and got there <strong>somehow</strong>, so there <strong>is</strong> an explanation. I don't care whose fault it is, I'd like to know <strong>how</strong> it got there and what we need to do to prevent it now that this has happened.&quot;</li>
</ul>
