<p>When receiving feedback on a design or other work the important thing is to see the <em>intent</em> behind the feedback and address that, rather than take the <em>specific</em> advice or try to <em>appease</em> the feedback-giver.</p>
<p>Only by addressing the intent behind the feedback can the work be improved. yes, this might mean taking the specific advice, but it might not. The specific advice may not be the right answer.</p>
<p>Appeasement is waste.</p>
