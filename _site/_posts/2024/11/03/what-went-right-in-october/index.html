<p>So many things, in retrospect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Home progress!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Landscaping is done, trees are in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storm drains are cleaned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network is regularly providing 1200Mbps, after modernizing a bit (paid for by selling the slightly older equipment)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work progress!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The concept sprint I led was a resounding success – the execs wish they could sell our plan now, but they recognize they need to wait until they fund it and we build it – and there's talk of more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pendulum is swinging back toward being more customer-centric</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life progress!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I pulled 410 last week by doing the plate math wrong, and it was no problem at all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At my last appointment my PT said &quot;good job;&quot; I bet PTs don't say that often</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
