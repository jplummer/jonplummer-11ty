            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I realized the other day that we (UX and others) make workflow diagrams but don’t distinguish in them between “system advances you to the next step&quot; or &quot;offers you a link to a relevant thing” versus “user has to know to go somewhere else to do a necessary thing.” These are not at all equivalent; the arrows look the same, but those that denote “user has to know to go somewhere else to do a thing” should be maybe painfully ugly or broken or perhaps not exist at all to point out that a barrier exists.</p>
<p>We should be anticipating and lowering those barriers, and we often are not. As we make new things, we’re tempted to squeeze scope down tight enough that we can launch quickly, but end up erecting these barriers in the process.</p>
<p>UX folks are interested in producing what I'll call <em>coordinated experiences</em>, but have learned (to my chagrin) that it's hard to convince other folks in product development to participate, so they give up after a while. Since it is natural for engineering to look at the platform from the data model outward and assume that the appropriate interfaces match the data model in structure, and since there should otherwise be sufficient demand to produce coordinated experiences rather than the uncoordinated ones we usually make, my hypothesis is that there's some incentive/pressure/habit that is leading us in product development to scope projects such that we're not spending the effort required to produce coordinated experiences.</p>
<p>Here's the rub: coordinated experience comes at an incremental cost. Or it seems to; that increment is <em>economically smart</em> to spend as it trades a bit more team effort for avoidance of a large amount of repeated customer, CSM, onboarding, and support effort.</p>
<p>It’s normal to want to make sure our initial attempts at a feature or improvement are small and manageable to deliver quickly, learn from the result, and reduce risk. It’s natural to want to get a small bit of software out into the world to see if customers find it valuable so that it will rightly draw further investment or not. But if the initial experience, however slim, includes barriers that hamper its use, those barriers confound the adoption or task success metrics we take as evidence that the feature is valuable. If we descope to the point that barriers are present we are at cross-purposes with ourselves.</p>
<p>So the challenge is to make small scopes that nonetheless deliver an end-to-end experience.</p>
<p>Example: Uber’s MVP was a web form that offered to book a car to arrive in the very near future. There was no map, no phone app, no scheduling, no ratings, no service options, none of the larger experience that we associate with ride sharing services today. But the core experience worked without assistance, off-system work visible to the user, or delay: you could request a car to appear at a particular location and it would. There was no barrier between the desire for a ride and a ride other than filling out the form, which you could do on your own. It was a slender experience but a complete, coordinated one.</p>
<h2>Coordinated experience defined</h2>
<p>A coordinated experience is one in which</p>
<ul>
<li>it's clear to the user where to go to achieve their goal</li>
<li>once there, the correct controls are intelligible and fall to hand as needed</li>
<li>users are helped by sensible defaults and/or canned possibilities they can try, and that suggest how the system is best used, rather than being faced with just a blank form</li>
<li>capabilities needed to accomplish the goal are available without having to go find them or know in advance where to get them</li>
<li>these capabilities behave in predictable ways learned from elsewhere in our platform and from other software</li>
<li>The system supports user confidence that they have achieved the correct result
<ul>
<li>the result of their work is clear</li>
<li>the right performance of the system is visible</li>
<li>it's clear how to make changes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the arrangement of capabilities and interfaces is governed by the use cases being supported, not necessarily the modularity of the back end.</p>
<p>(Yes, this is a basic UX concept, but it is forgotten so often that it needs a name outside of UX jargon.)</p>
<h2>Coordinated experience tactics</h2>
<p>We won’t need all of these tactics all the time for everything; it’s a set of possibilities. Some of these methods might be useful depending on the use cases we intend to support. Some will be overkill.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensible defaults</li>
<li>Galleries of canned options, useful at least as starting points</li>
<li>Cross-linking to dependent or involved system objects that are managed elsewhere</li>
<li>Reusing a capability (or presenting an otherwise stand-alone capability) as a module within a workflow where it is also needed</li>
<li>Selectors that offer a choice of the existing examples of the required object type and a convenient way to create a new one</li>
<li>Inspectors that explain a referenced system object without leaving the current context</li>
<li>Traceability (explain how a result was arrived at)</li>
<li>Simple versioning (accrue versions automatically as changes are made, allow an old one to be inspected and made current)</li>
<li>Hierarchies revealed in list views</li>
<li>(of course there are more; these are the ones that leap to mind at the moment)</li>
</ul>
<p>As we build up a library of coordinated experience patterns, such as object inspectors, galleries, simple versioning methods, etc. it should become easier and easier to create coordinated experiences over time. But the core method is making sure that small scopes result in complete, coordinated workflows rather than fragmented ones.</p>
<h2>Coordinated experience in the age of agents</h2>
<p>It’s common to hear that agentic AI will make traditional interfaces obsolete, that if you can just ask the computer to do a thing you won’t also need a manual workflow to do that thing. This suggests an exciting future when software can focus on doing what users want (or at least ask for) rather than providing tools for users to do what users want.</p>
<p>We do aspire to a near future where systems handle more tasks, and chain tasks together to produce better results more quickly than a person would, simplifying interaction by speeding the user along toward the results they seek.</p>
<p>However, users will still need to</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify performance of the system – monitor the actions of the system and understand its effect on their business</li>
<li>Verify agent recommendations – see that the agent’s recommendations or plans are sensible and well-founded in data, fostering confidence in the system and agent</li>
<li>Verify performance and results of agent tasks – confirm that the agent has done things correctly, and understand the effect of these actions</li>
<li>Understand the capabilities of the system – learn about what the system can do and how it is best used</li>
<li>Make adjustments – correct errors in their own work and that of agents, try tweaks, follow hunches</li>
</ul>
<p>This likely means that there’s plenty of interface! The emphasis shifts from the user directly manipulating the system toward the user being offered analyses and outcomes, but given the above needs users will continue to require systems that are</p>
<ul>
<li>self-explanatory</li>
<li>transparent in their operations</li>
<li>allow for direct inquiry into objects, and</li>
<li>enable direct manipulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The advent of agentic workflows, by reducing direct user operation of the system, will <em>intensify</em> the need for interfaces and workflows that are simple, coordinated and re-learnable rather than interfaces that depend on training, consultation, or practice for user success.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(This is a work in progress, but a pretty good start)</p>
<h2>Designing AI-powered product experiences</h2>
<h3>User needs and customer problem first</h3>
<p><strong>Solving a valuable customer problem is paramount</strong>. Before selecting any technological solution, including AI, we prioritize understanding user needs and clearly defining the problem we aim to solve. Any AI application must serve a genuine, identified user need, rather than being a solution in search of a problem.</p>
<h3>Transparency, explainability, and trust</h3>
<p>We recognize that users may be curious, or even apprehensive, about how AI-powered features operate. While full algorithmic explainability may not always be feasible or necessary, we commit to being <strong>transparent about the inputs and context</strong> that drive AI outputs. We hope to empower users with a <strong>sense of control</strong>, offering opportunities to <strong>validate choices, preview actions</strong>, and interact with AI as an assistant before letting it run as an autonomous agent. Maintaining an <strong>audit trail of AI actions</strong> also supports accountability and trust.</p>
<h3>Handling errors and edge cases</h3>
<p>We acknowledge that AI-powered features will sometimes produce wrong or unexpected outputs. Our design approach for these scenarios focuses on <strong>graceful error handling</strong> and keeping the <strong>human in the loop</strong>. This means</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anticipating and mitigating</strong> potential issues through careful AI setup and training</li>
<li>Designing interfaces that offer <strong>previews, recommendations, and clear actions</strong> rather than proceeding blindly</li>
<li>Ensuring mechanisms for users to easily <strong>correct, override, or provide feedback</strong> on AI outputs</li>
<li>Maintaining a design philosophy where the <strong>AI recommends and assists</strong>, allowing users to retain ultimate control until they explicitly release the system to act.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ethical design and bias mitigation</h3>
<p>We strive to <strong>reduce bias</strong> in AI-powered features by</p>
<ul>
<li>Grounding our understanding in <strong>real customer knowledge</strong> rather than internal assumptions.</li>
<li>Working with and analyzing <strong>customer data responsibly</strong>, without alteration, and ensuring its privacy and security</li>
<li>Establishing processes for <strong>monitoring the output of our features</strong> for unintended biases that may emerge</li>
</ul>
<h3>Iteration and learning through metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear project goals</strong> define success.</li>
<li><strong>Success metrics</strong> (e.g., accuracy, recall, task completion rates) and <strong>experiential metrics</strong> (e.g., user satisfaction, perceived control, trust) are established upfront.</li>
<li>Continuous <strong>monitoring and analysis of these metrics</strong> drive iterative improvement, allowing us to refine the AI's performance and the user experience over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using AI tools in day-to-day UX work</h2>
<p>Our UX team embraces the strategic and responsible integration of AI tools into our daily workflows to enhance our capabilities and deliver more valuable experiences.</p>
<h3>Strategic tool adoption and augmentation</h3>
<p>We are actively <strong>experimenting with AI tools</strong> like Figma Make, ChatGPT, and Gemini to understand their potential. Our focus is not merely on speed, but on how these tools can <strong>enhance our ability to deliver valuable and usable experiences</strong>. We view AI primarily as an augmentation to our existing skills, particularly for</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inspiration and ideation</strong>: Generating diverse concepts, content variations, or design alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>Early-stage prototyping</strong>: Quickly sketching out ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Analyzing research data</strong>: Identifying patterns or themes in qualitative data (with careful oversight).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Maintaining UX quality through human oversight</h3>
<p>The ultimate <strong>responsibility for UX quality remains with the human designer</strong> and the members of the team with which they work. When using AI tools, each designer is accountable for the quality and accuracy of the output on their projects, regardless of AI assistance. We commit to <strong>human oversight and critical evaluation</strong> of any AI-generated content or insights. AI is a tool to assist, not replace, the designer's judgment, expertise, and empathy. All AI-assisted work undergoes the same <strong>review and validation processes</strong> as any UX work.</p>
<h3>Continuous learning and cross-pollination</h3>
<p>We encourage designers to</p>
<ul>
<li>Actively <strong>experiment with new AI tools and techniques</strong></li>
<li><strong>Share their learnings and best practices</strong> with the wider UX team and their project teams</li>
<li>Replicate and build upon the successful experiments of others</li>
<li>Embrace a <strong>fluidity in job boundaries</strong>, recognizing that AI tools may enable designers to contribute to areas traditionally outside core UX, fostering greater cross-functional collaboration</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ethical use of AI tools and intellectual property</h3>
<p>Our ethical considerations for designing AI-powered products extend to our use of AI tools. We commit to</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Clearly acknowledging when AI tools have been used in our work, internally and externally where relevant. We will never misrepresent AI-assisted work as purely human-created</li>
<li><strong>Data privacy and IP</strong>: Exercising caution regarding proprietary or sensitive customer data when interacting with external AI models. We will ensure we adhere to company policies and legal guidelines regarding data input into AI tools and the intellectual property of generated outputs</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining control</strong>: Never ceding our understanding or control of customer knowledge, the design process, or design work to AI tools. The human designer remains the expert and ultimate decision-maker, responsible for the integrity of their work and the insights and design artifacts they share</li>
</ul>

This has raised other interesting topics that might also become topics, like how we really make money and where it goes, how our pricing and packaging works, etc. A lot of the things I was hoping to accomplish this year have been deprioritized (rightly) due to some technical pickles we find ourselves in, so this represents an opportunity to be influential beyond the usual process sand product stuff we do on the reg; fingers crossed.</li>

Sure, the fact that you need to push on the door a little bit to lock its deadbolt is not a huge deal; it hardly slows you down, takes little effort, and there's nearly no additional wear-and-tear as a result. Not a huge deal <em>once</em>, that is. Eight times a day every day as people come and go, sometimes with full hands or in a hurry, adds up to thousands of exactly-repeated minor annoyances per year with a single cause that is readily fixed. So the value of that fix is quite high, even if each incident is barely noticeable.</p>

<li>I adjusted the strike plates on our exterior doors as mentioned above. It's fab! (Ordinarily this would have been done by the contractor, but I put in the strikes so it fell to me.) Therese were not the strikes with the tab with the screwdriver hole, either.</li>
<li>I also some moved boxes and furniture out of the garage, and rearranged some things, so that we can now park one car in the garage. Halfway there!</li>
<li>During that process I started a tool donation box. There are some things that I've bought two or three times, and some things I have that I hope never to use again, and these can go to the tool library. Fish tape, transfer pump, redundant pipe wrench? Sayonara.</li>
<li>Adapting to people being out for summer trips (and to the recent upheaval in priorities) has not been as difficult as I expected, and it has been fun to dive into a little bit of design work to keep things moving for a team who has both designers out.</li>
<li>I had a delightful coffee with a former coworker who is looking for work. We've resolved to meet quarterly.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Small quality-of-life adjustments can have an amazing effect. Sure, the fact that you need to push on the door a little bit to lock its deadbolt is not a huge deal; it hardly slows you down, takes little effort, and there's nearly no additional wear-and-tear as a result. Not a huge deal...]]></description>

<ul>
<li>Juneteenth is worth celebrating, worth remembering, worth considering in this political moment.</li>
<li>I forgot that most of our walls are backed by plywood, so a towel bar installation I had put off was unexpectedly quick and dust-free.</li>
<li>The newish head of engineering thanked me for my attention and care to our common (and coming) process fixes.</li>
<li>The notion that we should (and that it makes economic sense to) focus on the things we can do that will help a lot of (and a lot of new) customers is starting to sink in among influential people. The notion that we should (and that it makes economic sense to) work a little harder so that our customers don't have to is taking a little more time, but I think we'll get there.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I fell off the weekly wins wagon <em>hard</em> in November, then wrote just one earlier this month. Time to get back on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social win – I saw a friend and past coworker who lives in town and it was lovely. I should reach out to more folks.</li>
<li>Social win – the parents and mother-in-law were in town for the girl's graduation, and brought their attendant challenges, but everything went just fine.</li>
<li>Social win – a different friend and past coworker who lives all the way across the country and I have agreed to chat monthly. No reason not to!</li>
<li>Lesson – plan, then check. When I've done just one or the other things have usually gone fine, but not always. This time a stainless steel part about 50mm square ($60 worth of material and cutting) was cut too large and is useless. Turns out it was my fault; all the other parts from the job are fine, I just missed double-checking the dimensions on the one piece. So I need to have that one redone. But the nice people at the fab have agreed to give my reorder special attention.</li>
<li>Leadership – I was able to take a work maneuver, reasserting focus on the goal, and use it with our HVAC subcontractor. &quot;<em>There's no explanation for water appearing there!</em>&quot; &quot;Ah, but water <strong>is</strong> there, and got there <strong>somehow</strong>, so there <strong>is</strong> an explanation. I don't care whose fault it is, I'd like to know <strong>how</strong> it got there and what we need to do to prevent it now that this has happened.&quot;</li>

So some wins have occurred since the last post, the highest of which have been</p>
<ul>
<li>High school is done, with great results. Good grades, an IB diploma, grandparents visiting, relief and happiness and the bittersweet knowledge that for some friendships this might be the last hurrah all in one.</li>
<li>We're in the house and it is great.</li>
<li>We got our full security deposit back with no argument, probably because we cleaned the hell out of the old place. And because the owners are nice. And because since they plan to move in the management company was losing the business anyway and it</li>
<li>I have an employee that has gotten some negative feedback; the core of it is old complaints, transmitted up the chain of command and lingering. People not working directly with the employee have formed persistent opinions that aren't accurate. How to extinguish the senior management echo of a problem that's been dealt with? Generate some data – survey the people the employee actually works with to monitor whether or not the positive behaviors in question are witnessed or not. Happily, the employee is taking it seriously, the team members are participating and helpful, and the numbers look good.</li>

            <title>Beta is not a release type</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beta is not a release type. Thinking of beta as a release type, essentially a quality level, leads teams to take something not ready for prime time, ship it to everyone, and call it &quot;beta&quot; to excuse its deficiencies. If you are making excuses for the deficiencies of your product you are probably doing it wrong, and it certainly doesn't feel good to do so.</p>
<p>Beta is a testing period. The purpose of beta testing is to take a product that you suspect might be ready for release and expose it to real users that will break it in ways you didn't think to test for. That implies a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>These users are testing the product, so you have things you would like them to do to make sure they are exercising the product fully. Therefore you have a testing plan.</li>
<li>You want these users to be active in testing the product, so you have selected them and are actively managing their activity and feedback. Therefore this is not a passive exercise.</li>
<li>Since you are actively testing the product, you are able to score and count the issues your testers find. The product can prove whether or not it is ready for general release. Therefore you have release criteria. and if you are doing it right you have one or more dates on which you will examine these criteria to determine if the product is ready for release.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, since beta is testing, you have a plan, participants, success criteria, and a decision point. If not, you're just trying to hide the fact that you don't care about quality as much as your users will.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At seventeen I joined the staff of a Boy Scout camp, and as an activity area leader I had a role to play in leadership, instruction, and the interactive programming that occurred each week. Each day had something special happening that made the schedule differ from one day to the next, making preparation, instruction, and even rest difficult. With scouts in camp for just a week at a time the strategy to engage them was clearly to make sure there was always a competition, series of skits, cookout, campfire show, ceremony, or recreational extremity (optional, happily: run off the end of the high pier! race to the far rock and back in an overloaded canoe! swim two miles in frigid water!) to draw attention and raise the available hype.</p>
<p>No one day was &quot;normal.&quot; There was no opportunity to settle into a routine, so there was lots of opportunity for scouts, generally between 11 and 16 years of age, to wind up in the wrong place, unsure of where they were supposed to be and how that matched up with what they wanted to be doing, swimming in options and unable to settle into a helpful routine.</p>
<p>It seems the same is true for knowledge workers – above a certain flavor of entry-level position, it's difficult to settle into a daily or weekly routine that would foster comfort in one's competence. It only gets worse as you enter into management or become a senior leader; you are constantly adapting, adjusting, re-focusing, trying and abandoning directions.</p>
<p>I've learned not to lament the lack of routine. This is the job. But I do try to create it for the people I support who need it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For me the centerpiece of a design exercise is seeking knowledge and adapting your design ideas to that knowledge. You create and adapt and discard ideas readily and easily if they don't fit the emerging situation. So it is essential to ask questions during the exercise to understand as much as you possibly can about the people, environment, stakeholders, goals, and constraints so that you can demonstrate this process.</p>
<p>You don't want the entire exercise to be taken up with this &quot;research&quot; activity – you do need to design something. So consider offering a very rough concept and then asking questions that will lead you either deeper into or away from that concept.</p>
<p>Example – imagine Home Depot had a magical way of printing and delivering orange aprons to new employees, and employee apron customization/self-expression is culturally important. What ideas does this spark? What do you want to know to confirm or discard some of these ideas?</p>
<p>My thoughts immediately go to a part of the new employee offer process that leads people to a website where they can customize an apron at their leisure. But these are hourly employees – the store manager is not going to want ANY work activity to be done outside of the store or in off hours. So the kernel of that idea needs to come in-store. Come to find out that they'd also like to offer this capability to existing employees. What is the technical environment in-store? How much time is the store manager willing to have an employee spend on this while on the clock? What are the required elements of apron customization and what are the optional ones? Etc. Understanding these you can sketch out a process that quickly gets the basics taken care of (perhaps in ONE or ZERO steps) and offers any options easily and quickly.</p>
<p>In a design exercise you'd do this all narratively – talk about the core idea, check it against their answers to your questions, change the core idea, sketch a little, ask more questions, adapt to the answers, etc.</p>

            <title>I don't offer a "UX process"</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My current employer is much like others in that it has a product management process, an engineering process, a design process, a customer onboarding process, a customer support process, etc.</p>
<p>What do you notice? That's right – each discipline group has a separate process. But what is it we are trying to ship?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you turn on a machine, and hammers come out, it's a machine designed to make hammers.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Canada, Harlem Children's Zone (paraphrased from memory)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're trying to ship a problem-solving, efficient, coherent, usable, pleasant, and effective piece of software. So our process, the design of our organization, needs to be arranged such that this is what the machine produces. We're not trying to ship a little bit of engineering, a little bit of design, a little bit of support, and a little bit of product management all shaken up in a bag.</p>
<p>So I don't offer a UX process. I talk about what the product development team needs to do informationally to get from the customer need to the satisfaction of that need. You've heard this before from me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: What benefit do our customers need? What problem are we solving?</li>
<li><strong>Concept</strong>: What concepts can we come up with to deliver that benefit? Which concept should we deliver? How should it work?</li>
<li><strong>Detail</strong>: How should it work specifically? As we work on this are we maintaining or improving usability, intelligibility, functionality, appeal?</li>
<li><strong>In Use</strong>: Are users successful in using it? How might we help them be more successful?</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll note that &quot;In Use&quot; folds right back into &quot;Benefit&quot; and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>The specifics of each informational phase might be organization-specific, but you'll need to harness all of the faculties of the product development organization, including (but not limited to) product management, design, engineering, customers, and users to do a good job in each phase. So this should be a single, integrated process.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thomasianwilson_next-time-someone-questions-you-as-a-researcher-activity-7136002995019780096-z-0W/">his LinkedIn post on November 29</a>, Thomas W. laid out a handful of arguments a designer or research could use to object to demands that UX &quot;prove its value.&quot; It feels good to read the list, but I don't recommend following his advice. I've used arguments like this before and heard the objections. In most cases the arguments are too high-level to meet the business where it is trying to operate, i.e. the points are a bit askew for a company hoping to change its business results in the near-term.</p>
<p>He lists these points. For each I mention the typical objection:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;<em>72% of businesses claim that improving customer experience (CX) is their #1 priority today.</em>&quot; – irrelevant</li>
<li>&quot;<em>80% of CEOs claim their customers’ experiences are superior, while only 8% of their customers think so.</em>&quot; – reflects the Dunning-Kreuger effect among those other dunces</li>
<li>&quot;<em>64% of people think that customer experience is more important than price in their choice of brand. (Gartner)</em>&quot; – we've been successful competing on price, too high-level to be actionable, is this for consumer, is it true in our industry</li>
<li><em>&quot;Companies that excel at their customer experience grow revenues 4-8% above their market (Bain)</em>&quot; – too high-level to be actionable, is this for consumer, is it true in our industry, which improvements matter</li>
<li>&quot;<em>$370 MM is the average amount of revenue generated by a modest improvement in Customer Experience over 3 years for a $1Billion company. (TemkinGroup)</em>&quot; – how much is modest, which improvements mattered, we are not in this cohort of companies</li>
<li>&quot;<em>Superior CX creates stronger loyalty turning customer into promoters with a LTV of 6-14X that of detractors (Bain)</em>&quot; – we spend a lot on CSMs as it is, are we already reaping this benefit, if so it's not enough</li>
<li>&quot;<em>89% of consumers cite customer experience as a critical loyalty Builder. (eConsultancy)</em>&quot; – correlative, sure but what's the effect on revenue</li>
<li>&quot;<em>92% of customers who rates their experience as Good were likely to repurchase from that company compared to 9% of customers who rated their experience as very poor. (TempkinGroup)</em>&quot; – we're already in the good category, is this true for our inductry, is this true for businesses like ours, and we're B2C so it's not relevant anhyow</li>
<li>&quot;<em>Experience Led business have 1.7 higher customer retention, 1.9x return on spend and 1.6x higher customer satisfaction. (Forrester)</em>&quot; – than what, is this for consumer, is this true in our industry, what does it mean to be &quot;experience-led&quot; and is that even a sensible thing for us to consider given where we are and how we work</li>
<li>&quot;<em>Brands with strong omni-channel engagement strategies retain an average of 89% of their customers (Aberdeen Group)</em>&quot; – we have good retention without &quot;strong omni-channel engagement strategies&quot; whatever that means</li>
<li>&quot;<em>Consumers with an emotional connection to a brand have 306% higher lifetime value and stay with a brand for an average of 5.1 years. (Motista)</em>&quot; – consumer, not for our industry, we're not in the emotion business, how does this apply to us specifically</li>
<li>&quot;<em>Organizations classifying themselves as advanced at CX are 3x more likely to have exceeded their goals (Adobe Analytics)</em>&quot; – self-reported, correlative, and indirect</li>
<li>&quot;<em>86% of customers have stopped doing business with a company after a single negative customer experience. (Harris Interactive)</em>&quot; – this is for consumer, we don't have a lot of direct customer interaction, we have projects to reduce the need for costly call center interactions, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The common thread among these objections is, in essence &quot;how does this high-level correlation apply to us, in our industry and situation, and guide our thinking now, in the near-term?&quot; And that's sensible. A company dissatisfied with its results wants to change something pronto and wants to choose that thing with some assurance that it will work.</p>
<p>The worst part, though is the last part, the part that will have a lot of UX and CX people cheering, the part that feels the best:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Now go ask your CTO or PM to show you metrics on the value of their code stack. Or their shitty MVP. Or their roadmap of fake metrics, costs and delivery dates. Ask to see where the actual value in ceremonies and sprints is. Ask them to show you how failing at 95% of the time is profitable to the business. Ask them to show you the value in terrible useless apps like Jira, Confluence and GitHub. Ask them to show you how democratized research and crowd sourced discovery and Qualitative is profitable.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>If I were to uncork this in a leadership meeting it would (rightly) be dismissed as snarky and combative. &quot;Ha ha, you suck too&quot; is not going to win anyone over.</p>
<p>Instead, how do we express our success in terms of user and customer behavior? How do we choose to learn about those behaviors? How do we choose to run experiments and make interventions that change those behaviors in measurable ways? That is where attention to experience should come from. it's common for organizations to be immature in this area, and we can lead them in the right direction.</p>

<li>A short work week is a beautiful thing. Having your entire department out for a day so you can catch up on administrative tasks is also nice, if a tad lonely.</li>
<li>The dreaded &quot;calibration meeting&quot; where you explain your people's reviews to your peer managers (our first at this company, so likely to be a bit fraught) went just fine. No drama.</li>
<li>Although my three vaccines set my night (and the following day) on fire, folks were understanding and I recovered quickly.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In spite of the organization's urges to snap back to old ways (ways that got us to where we are, so are not sufficient on their own to change our results):</p>
<ul>
<li>My people are not overreacting to the politics…</li>
<li>…assisted by their work in making us more customer-centric being shouted-out in public forums by the CEO…</li>
<li>…who is also publicly mentioning themes that have been part of my mission at the company since I was hired.</li>
</ul>
<p>This all is setting me up perfectly to talk about quality and how the product needs to change (i.e. what we need to organize ourselves to produce) at the offsite after Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm in the interview panel for the new product leader for a key product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting times!</p>
