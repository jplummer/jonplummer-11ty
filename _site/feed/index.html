            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I realized the other day that we (UX and others) make workflow diagrams but don’t distinguish in them between “system advances you to the next step&quot; or &quot;offers you a link to a relevant thing” versus “user has to know to go somewhere else to do a necessary thing.” These are not at all equivalent; the arrows look the same, but those that denote “user has to know to go somewhere else to do a thing” should be maybe painfully ugly or broken or perhaps not exist at all to point out that a barrier exists.</p>
<p>We should be anticipating and lowering those barriers, and we often are not. As we make new things, we’re tempted to squeeze scope down tight enough that we can launch quickly, but end up erecting these barriers in the process.</p>
<p>UX folks are interested in producing what I'll call <em>coordinated experiences</em>, but have learned (to my chagrin) that it's hard to convince other folks in product development to participate, so they give up after a while. Since it is natural for engineering to look at the platform from the data model outward and assume that the appropriate interfaces match the data model in structure, and since there should otherwise be sufficient demand to produce coordinated experiences rather than the uncoordinated ones we usually make, my hypothesis is that there's some incentive/pressure/habit that is leading us in product development to scope projects such that we're not spending the effort required to produce coordinated experiences.</p>
<p>Here's the rub: coordinated experience comes at an incremental cost. Or it seems to; that increment is <em>economically smart</em> to spend as it trades a bit more team effort for avoidance of a large amount of repeated customer, CSM, onboarding, and support effort.</p>
<p>It’s normal to want to make sure our initial attempts at a feature or improvement are small and manageable to deliver quickly, learn from the result, and reduce risk. It’s natural to want to get a small bit of software out into the world to see if customers find it valuable so that it will rightly draw further investment or not. But if the initial experience, however slim, includes barriers that hamper its use, those barriers confound the adoption or task success metrics we take as evidence that the feature is valuable. If we descope to the point that barriers are present we are at cross-purposes with ourselves.</p>
<p>So the challenge is to make small scopes that nonetheless deliver an end-to-end experience.</p>
<p>Example: Uber’s MVP was a web form that offered to book a car to arrive in the very near future. There was no map, no phone app, no scheduling, no ratings, no service options, none of the larger experience that we associate with ride sharing services today. But the core experience worked without assistance, off-system work visible to the user, or delay: you could request a car to appear at a particular location and it would. There was no barrier between the desire for a ride and a ride other than filling out the form, which you could do on your own. It was a slender experience but a complete, coordinated one.</p>
<h2>Coordinated experience defined</h2>
<p>A coordinated experience is one in which</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it's clear to the user where to go to achieve their goal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>once there, the correct controls are intelligible and fall to hand as needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>users are helped by sensible defaults and/or canned possibilities they can try, and that suggest how the system is best used, rather than being faced with just a blank form</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>capabilities needed to accomplish the goal are available without having to go find them or know in advance where to get them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>these capabilities behave in predictable ways learned from elsewhere in our platform and from other software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system supports user confidence that they have achieved the correct result</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the result of their work is clear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the right performance of the system is visible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it's clear how to make changes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the arrangement of capabilities and interfaces is governed by the use cases being supported, not necessarily the modularity of the back end.</p>
<p>(Yes, this is a basic UX concept, but it is forgotten so often that it needs a name outside of UX jargon.)</p>
<h2>Coordinated experience tactics</h2>
<p>We won’t need all of these tactics all the time for everything; it’s a set of possibilities. Some of these methods might be useful depending on the use cases we intend to support. Some will be overkill.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sensible defaults</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Galleries of canned options, useful at least as starting points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-linking to dependent or involved system objects that are managed elsewhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reusing a capability (or presenting an otherwise stand-alone capability) as a module within a workflow where it is also needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selectors that offer a choice of the existing examples of the required object type and a convenient way to create a new one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspectors that explain a referenced system object without leaving the current context</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traceability (explain how a result was arrived at)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple versioning (accrue versions automatically as changes are made, allow an old one to be inspected and made current)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hierarchies revealed in list views</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(of course there are more; these are the ones that leap to mind at the moment)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As we build up a library of coordinated experience patterns, such as object inspectors, galleries, simple versioning methods, etc. it should become easier and easier to create coordinated experiences over time. But the core method is making sure that small scopes result in complete, coordinated workflows rather than fragmented ones.</p>
<h2>Coordinated experience in the age of agents</h2>
<p>It’s common to hear that agentic AI will make traditional interfaces obsolete, that if you can just ask the computer to do a thing you won’t also need a manual workflow to do that thing. This suggests an exciting future when software can focus on doing what users want (or at least ask for) rather than providing tools for users to do what users want.</p>
<p>We do aspire to a near future where systems handle more tasks, and chain tasks together to produce better results more quickly than a person would, simplifying interaction by speeding the user along toward the results they seek.</p>
<p>However, users will still need to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Verify performance of the system – monitor the actions of the system and understand its effect on their business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify agent recommendations – see that the agent’s recommendations or plans are sensible and well-founded in data, fostering confidence in the system and agent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify performance and results of agent tasks – confirm that the agent has done things correctly, and understand the effect of these actions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the capabilities of the system – learn about what the system can do and how it is best used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make adjustments – correct errors in their own work and that of agents, try tweaks, follow hunches</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This likely means that there’s plenty of interface! The emphasis shifts from the user directly manipulating the system toward the user being offered analyses and outcomes, but given the above needs users will continue to require systems that are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>self-explanatory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transparent in their operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allow for direct inquiry into objects, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enable direct manipulation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The advent of agentic workflows, by reducing direct user operation of the system, will <em>intensify</em> the need for interfaces and workflows that are simple, coordinated and re-learnable rather than interfaces that depend on training, consultation, or practice for user success.</p>

            <title>Our position on AI tools</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(This is a work in progress, but a pretty good start)</p>
<h2>Designing AI-powered product experiences</h2>
<h3>User needs and customer problem first</h3>
<p><strong>Solving a valuable customer problem is paramount</strong>. Before selecting any technological solution, including AI, we prioritize understanding user needs and clearly defining the problem we aim to solve. Any AI application must serve a genuine, identified user need, rather than being a solution in search of a problem.</p>
<h3>Transparency, explainability, and trust</h3>
<p>We recognize that users may be curious, or even apprehensive, about how AI-powered features operate. While full algorithmic explainability may not always be feasible or necessary, we commit to being <strong>transparent about the inputs and context</strong> that drive AI outputs. We hope to empower users with a <strong>sense of control</strong>, offering opportunities to <strong>validate choices, preview actions</strong>, and interact with AI as an assistant before letting it run as an autonomous agent. Maintaining an <strong>audit trail of AI actions</strong> also supports accountability and trust.</p>
<h3>Handling errors and edge cases</h3>
<p>We acknowledge that AI-powered features will sometimes produce wrong or unexpected outputs. Our design approach for these scenarios focuses on <strong>graceful error handling</strong> and keeping the <strong>human in the loop</strong>. This means</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Anticipating and mitigating</strong> potential issues through careful AI setup and training</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designing interfaces that offer <strong>previews, recommendations, and clear actions</strong> rather than proceeding blindly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring mechanisms for users to easily <strong>correct, override, or provide feedback</strong> on AI outputs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining a design philosophy where the <strong>AI recommends and assists</strong>, allowing users to retain ultimate control until they explicitly release the system to act.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ethical design and bias mitigation</h3>
<p>We strive to <strong>reduce bias</strong> in AI-powered features by</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grounding our understanding in <strong>real customer knowledge</strong> rather than internal assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with and analyzing <strong>customer data responsibly</strong>, without alteration, and ensuring its privacy and security</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing processes for <strong>monitoring the output of our features</strong> for unintended biases that may emerge</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Iteration and learning through metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clear project goals</strong> define success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Success metrics</strong> (e.g., accuracy, recall, task completion rates) and <strong>experiential metrics</strong> (e.g., user satisfaction, perceived control, trust) are established upfront.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuous <strong>monitoring and analysis of these metrics</strong> drive iterative improvement, allowing us to refine the AI's performance and the user experience over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using AI tools in day-to-day UX work</h2>
<p>Our UX team embraces the strategic and responsible integration of AI tools into our daily workflows to enhance our capabilities and deliver more valuable experiences.</p>
<h3>Strategic tool adoption and augmentation</h3>
<p>We are actively <strong>experimenting with AI tools</strong> like Figma Make, ChatGPT, and Gemini to understand their potential. Our focus is not merely on speed, but on how these tools can <strong>enhance our ability to deliver valuable and usable experiences</strong>. We view AI primarily as an augmentation to our existing skills, particularly for</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Inspiration and ideation</strong>: Generating diverse concepts, content variations, or design alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Early-stage prototyping</strong>: Quickly sketching out ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analyzing research data</strong>: Identifying patterns or themes in qualitative data (with careful oversight).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Maintaining UX quality through human oversight</h3>
<p>The ultimate <strong>responsibility for UX quality remains with the human designer</strong> and the members of the team with which they work. When using AI tools, each designer is accountable for the quality and accuracy of the output on their projects, regardless of AI assistance. We commit to <strong>human oversight and critical evaluation</strong> of any AI-generated content or insights. AI is a tool to assist, not replace, the designer's judgment, expertise, and empathy. All AI-assisted work undergoes the same <strong>review and validation processes</strong> as any UX work.</p>
<h3>Continuous learning and cross-pollination</h3>
<p>We encourage designers to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Actively <strong>experiment with new AI tools and techniques</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Share their learnings and best practices</strong> with the wider UX team and their project teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replicate and build upon the successful experiments of others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace a <strong>fluidity in job boundaries</strong>, recognizing that AI tools may enable designers to contribute to areas traditionally outside core UX, fostering greater cross-functional collaboration</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ethical use of AI tools and intellectual property</h3>
<p>Our ethical considerations for designing AI-powered products extend to our use of AI tools. We commit to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>: Clearly acknowledging when AI tools have been used in our work, internally and externally where relevant. We will never misrepresent AI-assisted work as purely human-created</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data privacy and IP</strong>: Exercising caution regarding proprietary or sensitive customer data when interacting with external AI models. We will ensure we adhere to company policies and legal guidelines regarding data input into AI tools and the intellectual property of generated outputs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintaining control</strong>: Never ceding our understanding or control of customer knowledge, the design process, or design work to AI tools. The human designer remains the expert and ultimate decision-maker, responsible for the integrity of their work and the insights and design artifacts they share</p>
</li>
</ul>

This has raised other interesting topics that might also become topics, like how we really make money and where it goes, how our pricing and packaging works, etc. A lot of the things I was hoping to accomplish this year have been deprioritized (rightly) due to some technical pickles we find ourselves in, so this represents an opportunity to be influential beyond the usual process sand product stuff we do on the reg; fingers crossed.</p>

<p>The ladies are back and the house is no longer empty. This also means my diet will improve – bachelor-mode Jon is (far) less disciplined than husband-mode Jon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Small quality-of-life adjustments can have an amazing effect. Sure, the fact that you need to push on the door a little bit to lock its deadbolt is not a huge deal; it hardly slows you down, takes little effort, and there's nearly no additional wear-and-tear as a result. Not a huge deal <em>once</em>, that is. Eight times a day every day as people come and go, sometimes with full hands or in a hurry, adds up to thousands of exactly-repeated minor annoyances per year with a single cause that is readily fixed. So the value of that fix is quite high, even if each incident is barely noticeable.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I adjusted the strike plates on our exterior doors as mentioned above. It's fab! (Ordinarily this would have been done by the contractor, but I put in the strikes so it fell to me.) Therese were not the strikes with the tab with the screwdriver hole, either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also some moved boxes and furniture out of the garage, and rearranged some things, so that we can now park one car in the garage. Halfway there!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During that process I started a tool donation box. There are some things that I've bought two or three times, and some things I have that I hope never to use again, and these can go to the tool library. Fish tape, transfer pump, redundant pipe wrench? Sayonara.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adapting to people being out for summer trips (and to the recent upheaval in priorities) has not been as difficult as I expected, and it has been fun to dive into a little bit of design work to keep things moving for a team who has both designers out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had a delightful coffee with a former coworker who is looking for work. We've resolved to meet quarterly.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Juneteenth is worth celebrating, worth remembering, worth considering in this political moment.</p>

<p>I forgot that most of our walls are backed by plywood, so a towel bar installation I had put off was unexpectedly quick and dust-free.</p>

<p>The newish head of engineering thanked me for my attention and care to our common (and coming) process fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notion that we should (and that it makes economic sense to) focus on the things we can do that will help a lot of (and a lot of new) customers is starting to sink in among influential people. The notion that we should (and that it makes economic sense to) work a little harder so that our customers don't have to is taking a little more time, but I think we'll get there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I fell off the weekly wins wagon <em>hard</em> in November, then wrote just one earlier this month. Time to get back on.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social win – I saw a friend and past coworker who lives in town and it was lovely. I should reach out to more folks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social win – the parents and mother-in-law were in town for the girl's graduation, and brought their attendant challenges, but everything went just fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social win – a different friend and past coworker who lives all the way across the country and I have agreed to chat monthly. No reason not to!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lesson – plan, then check. When I've done just one or the other things have usually gone fine, but not always. This time a stainless steel part about 50mm square ($60 worth of material and cutting) was cut too large and is useless. Turns out it was my fault; all the other parts from the job are fine, I just missed double-checking the dimensions on the one piece. So I need to have that one redone. But the nice people at the fab have agreed to give my reorder special attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership – I was able to take a work maneuver, reasserting focus on the goal, and use it with our HVAC subcontractor. &quot;<em>There's no explanation for water appearing there!</em>&quot; &quot;Ah, but water <strong>is</strong> there, and got there <strong>somehow</strong>, so there <strong>is</strong> an explanation. I don't care whose fault it is, I'd like to know <strong>how</strong> it got there and what we need to do to prevent it now that this has happened.&quot;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been a bit since I did a &quot;weekly wins&quot; post, mostly because of…lassitude…but with the convenient excuse that we've been finishing the house project and moving and setting up and shepherding the girl through the last bits of high school. So some wins have occurred since the last post, the highest of which have been</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High school is done, with great results. Good grades, an IB diploma, grandparents visiting, relief and happiness and the bittersweet knowledge that for some friendships this might be the last hurrah all in one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're in the house and it is great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We got our full security deposit back with no argument, probably because we cleaned the hell out of the old place. And because the owners are nice. And because since they plan to move in the management company was losing the business anyway and it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have an employee that has gotten some negative feedback; the core of it is old complaints, transmitted up the chain of command and lingering. People not working directly with the employee have formed persistent opinions that aren't accurate. How to extinguish the senior management echo of a problem that's been dealt with? Generate some data – survey the people the employee actually works with to monitor whether or not the positive behaviors in question are witnessed or not. Happily, the employee is taking it seriously, the team members are participating and helpful, and the numbers look good.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beta is not a release type. Thinking of beta as a release type, essentially a quality level, leads teams to take something not ready for prime time, ship it to everyone, and call it &quot;beta&quot; to excuse its deficiencies. If you are making excuses for the deficiencies of your product you are probably doing it wrong, and it certainly doesn't feel good to do so.</p>
<p>Beta is a testing period. The purpose of beta testing is to take a product that you suspect might be ready for release and expose it to real users that will break it in ways you didn't think to test for. That implies a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These users are testing the product, so you have things you would like them to do to make sure they are exercising the product fully. Therefore you have a testing plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want these users to be active in testing the product, so you have selected them and are actively managing their activity and feedback. Therefore this is not a passive exercise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since you are actively testing the product, you are able to score and count the issues your testers find. The product can prove whether or not it is ready for general release. Therefore you have release criteria. and if you are doing it right you have one or more dates on which you will examine these criteria to determine if the product is ready for release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, since beta is testing, you have a plan, participants, success criteria, and a decision point. If not, you're just trying to hide the fact that you don't care about quality as much as your users will.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At seventeen I joined the staff of a Boy Scout camp, and as an activity area leader I had a role to play in leadership, instruction, and the interactive programming that occurred each week. Each day had something special happening that made the schedule differ from one day to the next, making preparation, instruction, and even rest difficult. With scouts in camp for just a week at a time the strategy to engage them was clearly to make sure there was always a competition, series of skits, cookout, campfire show, ceremony, or recreational extremity (optional, happily: run off the end of the high pier! race to the far rock and back in an overloaded canoe! swim two miles in frigid water!) to draw attention and raise the available hype.</p>
<p>No one day was &quot;normal.&quot; There was no opportunity to settle into a routine, so there was lots of opportunity for scouts, generally between 11 and 16 years of age, to wind up in the wrong place, unsure of where they were supposed to be and how that matched up with what they wanted to be doing, swimming in options and unable to settle into a helpful routine.</p>
<p>It seems the same is true for knowledge workers – above a certain flavor of entry-level position, it's difficult to settle into a daily or weekly routine that would foster comfort in one's competence. It only gets worse as you enter into management or become a senior leader; you are constantly adapting, adjusting, re-focusing, trying and abandoning directions.</p>
<p>I've learned not to lament the lack of routine. This is the job. But I do try to create it for the people I support who need it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For me the centerpiece of a design exercise is seeking knowledge and adapting your design ideas to that knowledge. You create and adapt and discard ideas readily and easily if they don't fit the emerging situation. So it is essential to ask questions during the exercise to understand as much as you possibly can about the people, environment, stakeholders, goals, and constraints so that you can demonstrate this process.</p>
<p>You don't want the entire exercise to be taken up with this &quot;research&quot; activity – you do need to design something. So consider offering a very rough concept and then asking questions that will lead you either deeper into or away from that concept.</p>
<p>Example – imagine Home Depot had a magical way of printing and delivering orange aprons to new employees, and employee apron customization/self-expression is culturally important. What ideas does this spark? What do you want to know to confirm or discard some of these ideas?</p>
<p>My thoughts immediately go to a part of the new employee offer process that leads people to a website where they can customize an apron at their leisure. But these are hourly employees – the store manager is not going to want ANY work activity to be done outside of the store or in off hours. So the kernel of that idea needs to come in-store. Come to find out that they'd also like to offer this capability to existing employees. What is the technical environment in-store? How much time is the store manager willing to have an employee spend on this while on the clock? What are the required elements of apron customization and what are the optional ones? Etc. Understanding these you can sketch out a process that quickly gets the basics taken care of (perhaps in ONE or ZERO steps) and offers any options easily and quickly.</p>
<p>In a design exercise you'd do this all narratively – talk about the core idea, check it against their answers to your questions, change the core idea, sketch a little, ask more questions, adapt to the answers, etc.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My current employer is much like others in that it has a product management process, an engineering process, a design process, a customer onboarding process, a customer support process, etc.</p>
<p>What do you notice? That's right – each discipline group has a separate process. But what is it we are trying to ship?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you turn on a machine, and hammers come out, it's a machine designed to make hammers.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Canada, Harlem Children's Zone (paraphrased from memory)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're trying to ship a problem-solving, efficient, coherent, usable, pleasant, and effective piece of software. So our process, the design of our organization, needs to be arranged such that this is what the machine produces. We're not trying to ship a little bit of engineering, a little bit of design, a little bit of support, and a little bit of product management all shaken up in a bag.</p>
<p>So I don't offer a UX process. I talk about what the product development team needs to do informationally to get from the customer need to the satisfaction of that need. You've heard this before from me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: What benefit do our customers need? What problem are we solving?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concept</strong>: What concepts can we come up with to deliver that benefit? Which concept should we deliver? How should it work?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Detail</strong>: How should it work specifically? As we work on this are we maintaining or improving usability, intelligibility, functionality, appeal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In Use</strong>: Are users successful in using it? How might we help them be more successful?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll note that &quot;In Use&quot; folds right back into &quot;Benefit&quot; and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>The specifics of each informational phase might be organization-specific, but you'll need to harness all of the faculties of the product development organization, including (but not limited to) product management, design, engineering, customers, and users to do a good job in each phase. So this should be a single, integrated process.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thomasianwilson_next-time-someone-questions-you-as-a-researcher-activity-7136002995019780096-z-0W/">his LinkedIn post on November 29</a>, Thomas W. laid out a handful of arguments a designer or research could use to object to demands that UX &quot;prove its value.&quot; It feels good to read the list, but I don't recommend following his advice. I've used arguments like this before and heard the objections. In most cases the arguments are too high-level to meet the business where it is trying to operate, i.e. the points are a bit askew for a company hoping to change its business results in the near-term.</p>
<p>He lists these points. For each I mention the typical objection:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>72% of businesses claim that improving customer experience (CX) is their #1 priority today.</em>&quot; – irrelevant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>80% of CEOs claim their customers’ experiences are superior, while only 8% of their customers think so.</em>&quot; – reflects the Dunning-Kreuger effect among those other dunces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>64% of people think that customer experience is more important than price in their choice of brand. (Gartner)</em>&quot; – we've been successful competing on price, too high-level to be actionable, is this for consumer, is it true in our industry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>&quot;Companies that excel at their customer experience grow revenues 4-8% above their market (Bain)</em>&quot; – too high-level to be actionable, is this for consumer, is it true in our industry, which improvements matter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>$370 MM is the average amount of revenue generated by a modest improvement in Customer Experience over 3 years for a $1Billion company. (TemkinGroup)</em>&quot; – how much is modest, which improvements mattered, we are not in this cohort of companies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>Superior CX creates stronger loyalty turning customer into promoters with a LTV of 6-14X that of detractors (Bain)</em>&quot; – we spend a lot on CSMs as it is, are we already reaping this benefit, if so it's not enough</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>89% of consumers cite customer experience as a critical loyalty Builder. (eConsultancy)</em>&quot; – correlative, sure but what's the effect on revenue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>92% of customers who rates their experience as Good were likely to repurchase from that company compared to 9% of customers who rated their experience as very poor. (TempkinGroup)</em>&quot; – we're already in the good category, is this true for our inductry, is this true for businesses like ours, and we're B2C so it's not relevant anhyow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>Experience Led business have 1.7 higher customer retention, 1.9x return on spend and 1.6x higher customer satisfaction. (Forrester)</em>&quot; – than what, is this for consumer, is this true in our industry, what does it mean to be &quot;experience-led&quot; and is that even a sensible thing for us to consider given where we are and how we work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>Brands with strong omni-channel engagement strategies retain an average of 89% of their customers (Aberdeen Group)</em>&quot; – we have good retention without &quot;strong omni-channel engagement strategies&quot; whatever that means</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>Consumers with an emotional connection to a brand have 306% higher lifetime value and stay with a brand for an average of 5.1 years. (Motista)</em>&quot; – consumer, not for our industry, we're not in the emotion business, how does this apply to us specifically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>Organizations classifying themselves as advanced at CX are 3x more likely to have exceeded their goals (Adobe Analytics)</em>&quot; – self-reported, correlative, and indirect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<em>86% of customers have stopped doing business with a company after a single negative customer experience. (Harris Interactive)</em>&quot; – this is for consumer, we don't have a lot of direct customer interaction, we have projects to reduce the need for costly call center interactions, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The common thread among these objections is, in essence &quot;how does this high-level correlation apply to us, in our industry and situation, and guide our thinking now, in the near-term?&quot; And that's sensible. A company dissatisfied with its results wants to change something pronto and wants to choose that thing with some assurance that it will work.</p>
<p>The worst part, though is the last part, the part that will have a lot of UX and CX people cheering, the part that feels the best:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Now go ask your CTO or PM to show you metrics on the value of their code stack. Or their shitty MVP. Or their roadmap of fake metrics, costs and delivery dates. Ask to see where the actual value in ceremonies and sprints is. Ask them to show you how failing at 95% of the time is profitable to the business. Ask them to show you the value in terrible useless apps like Jira, Confluence and GitHub. Ask them to show you how democratized research and crowd sourced discovery and Qualitative is profitable.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>If I were to uncork this in a leadership meeting it would (rightly) be dismissed as snarky and combative. &quot;Ha ha, you suck too&quot; is not going to win anyone over.</p>
<p>Instead, how do we express our success in terms of user and customer behavior? How do we choose to learn about those behaviors? How do we choose to run experiments and make interventions that change those behaviors in measurable ways? That is where attention to experience should come from. it's common for organizations to be immature in this area, and we can lead them in the right direction.</p>

            <title>Make MVPs experiments again</title>
            <link>/_posts/2023/11/18/make-mvps-experiments-again/</link>
            <guid>/_posts/2023/11/18/make-mvps-experiments-again/</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri Nov 17 2023 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Background</h2>
<p>There seems to be broad agreement within engineering leadership that MVP is (or should be) a <strong>philosophy of experimentation and hypothesis testing</strong>. An MVP should seek to validate a hypothesis. Literature discusses a Minimum Viable Product as the cheapest and fastest possible experiment that can answer a business question.</p>
<p>Yet our cross-functional teams seem often to be treating MVP as meaning “the first release” or, worse, “the first kind of quick get-it-out-there release” of a feature, improvement, or change. Some passion projects make it to general availability without cross-functional attention. Still other items wind up in the product with a “beta” flag and are not revisited. And rarely is data collected from these to determine if they are successful. We console ourselves with the idea that these are experimental but we often don’t behave as if we are actually experimenting. So we aren’t in these cases fulfilling the idea that an MVP is intended to collect validated learning about customers with minimal effort. What’s worse, we infrequently return to these releases to improve them, withdraw them, or build upon them.</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>The ultimate effect of the above is that there are items we call experiments, half-baked, scattered around the platform, and we have little understanding of their fitness to task for our customers and users. As a result</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Things that should be either deprecated or improved lead to an incoherent and unusable experience for our users, making demos (sales) more difficult and depressing user satisfaction (which can contribute to churn)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The product has inconsistent interaction paradigms, styling, labeling, and messaging, which enhance the <em>perception</em> of poor usability even when things are sufficiently usable</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We say we are &quot;shipping to learn&quot; but we are not doing the work needed to <em>actually</em> learn.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improve the effectiveness of our live software experiments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raise the level of quality visible to users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage downward the overall level of technical and interactive debt visible to users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve teamwork in part by firming up our working definitions of important terms such as MVP, alpha, beta, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider not using the term MVP – it has become so distorted in its use that it lacks useful meaning in practice</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proposed Intervention</h2>
<p>Make experiments experiments again by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Carefully selecting projects for live experimentation according to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Limited scope</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearly-articulated hypothesis</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-determine the success metrics and decision date for any experiment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expose a limited set of customers to an experimental release, producing a basis for comparison (limited release customers vs the rest of the population)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the appointed time, on the basis of the agreed-upon metrics, decide to do one of</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Withdraw the experiment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterate on the experiment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare for general availability/transition to regular feature development process</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost/Benefit</h2>
<p><strong>Costs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Slight additional effort to plan experiments and evaluate the results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional cost to instrument MVPs so they can be evaluated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost in technically and interactively hardening experiments that succeed (should happen, doesn’t always at the moment)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slight additional effort to withdraw experiments that fail</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduced technical and interactive debt due to each experiment having an end date and being either withdrawn or hardened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced waste releasing fully baked or hardened projects that don't meet customer needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved interactive quality of items that make it to general availability may lead indirectly to less churn, greater CSAT, improved quality visible to users</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For new ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gain broad agreement on the definition of an experiment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer guidelines for when to run a software experiment live or to choose other means of experimentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer guidelines for running an experiment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pilot by</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Selecting a hypothesis and means of testing it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting date and criteria for evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instrumenting, launching experiment, and collecting data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluating the results at the appointed time and making the withdraw/iterate/prepare decision, creating a new project if needed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review feedback and results from pilot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share best practices/expectations with department</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Profit!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For old ideas (fits with our objective to deprecate crufty and unused things)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Offer items to address – what features seem to be experiments that were not evaluated, that are suspect?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we know if this is doing what it should?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We know what result it should produce – measure that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s doing well – are we happy with the quality?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes – yahtzee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No – remedial “prepare for general availability”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s doing OK – iterate on the experiment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s not doing well</p>
<ul>
<li>Is that strategically relevant?
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes – iterate on the experiment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No – candidate for withdrawal</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’re not sure what result it should produce</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it being used?
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes – how and why</p>
<ul>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>No – candidate for withdrawal</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Things we need to teach/encourage/expect/insist on</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Working from hypotheses and measures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feed the innovation pipeline with clarity on customer problems we are interested in solving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider examples at various sizes/complexities to break down into experiments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need a company-wide framework to help us consider ideas for experimentation, from the customer problem/jtbd/benefit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raise the level of direct product use knowledge/experience among engineers and designers – better have operated the thing you are working on</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things are a bit of a mess at work – a couple of key people have resigned, the 4th quarter roadmap is in turmoil, revenue is going up but there's still plenty of ground to make up, and a recent launch and post-mortem has <em>raised a lot of feelings</em> and inspired a lot of _should_ing among the leadership. (Folks should know not to <em>should</em> on themselves or others.) Even so,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That fraught project and launch, the one that has caused a lot of teeth to be gnashed, is getting good feedback and excitement form actual customers, and so far few bugs have been reported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roadmap, departures, and <em>should</em> situation present an opportunity (that I am happy to seize) to push us into more user-centricity and and agreement on quality, if only we can dispel some of the persistent misconceptions about the project triggering some of this swirl. There's a leadership offsite coming up that I'm all too happy to throw a couple of thought-bombs into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My team is being surprisingly even-keeled about the whole thing. I'm so grateful!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I rode a motorcycle I was on the back, clinging to my college roommate. He happened to have a second helmet, it fit well enough, and I was eager to get to the other side of campus.</p>
<p>He gave me two instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Keep your feet on the pegs.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;I am not a steering wheel.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you guess which instruction he complained about at the end of the ride?</p>
<p>Here's a hint – it's easier for a not-already-knowledgeable person to follow a positively-worded instruction (do this) than a negatively-worded instruction (don't do that). It's even harder to follow an instruction when it relies on a metaphor, as it's less clear, less obvious, less instructive. The combination of negatively-worded and unclear is worse yet.</p>
<p>I should have asked clarifying questions, like &quot;what would it feel like if I was treating you as a steering wheel?&quot; but I didn't think to at the time.</p>
<p>At work we just did a retro on a somewhat fraught and over-large project, and much of the raw conclusions are negatively-worded. Some are metaphorical. The people involved are knowledgeable but from different disciplines, so the level of shared understanding is probably lower than people guess. So a lot of &quot;don't do X, don't do Y&quot; will probably not get the results we seek. I'll be helping to bend these into positively-worded instructions today. I suspect our success will depend on it.</p>

<p>I'm trying to coach some designers along the path of feeling comfortable adjusting and evolving approaches that have been learned in school (vs believing that there is a single &quot;right&quot; way and that design quality is aligned to how closely they execute against that &quot;textbook&quot; approach). I'd like to be able to share something with them that demonstrates that the higher one's design maturity, the more comfortable/ confident one is with adjusting approaches and trying new things based on context and experience... and that this is a good thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't have a framework or model to point to, but the thing that strikes me as interesting about this question is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>design quality is aligned to how closely they execute against that &quot;textbook&quot; approach</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might be worth pointing out that this is an inward-looking, appeal-to-authority view of quality, measured in the wrong place. Design quality is actually measured by the attainment of user ease and satisfaction coupled with business results, and these do not depend on method adherence. The methods exist to help you get the information you need to achieve these results but they do not deliver these results themselves.</p>

<p>New mentees continue to appear. Some of them aren't actually mentees but doing a little market or product research, but I don't mind as long as their questions are relevant to my interests. It's a tough time for entry-level UX people, but I hope I am helpful to them with my seemingly slightly-offbeat advice.

Researchers, new designers, more senior folks, etc. Some of my advice has started to converge (apparently I'm consistent in what I think!), but I believe I'm giving an appropriate level of individual attention to each person and not spouting platitudes.

            <pubDate>Fri Sep 15 2023 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new mentee opened the session with (paraphrased)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I convince leadership to care about UX research?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a broad question. A giant question. It's highly situational; it's hard to answer without deep knowledge of the organization's goals, its failings, and the people involved.</p>
<p>After a bit of conversation it became clear that the actual question was a little smaller. Paraphrased,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our CTO is placing a lot of emphasis on <em>summative</em> research activities like usability testing. I don't want to neglect, and am more interested in, <em>formative</em> research. How do I convince him to let me do formative research?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, that's still a big question, of the sort that a disinterested third party (me) can't answer directly. But it led us to talk about a few topics:</p>
<h2>1. People have their reasons. What are they?</h2>
<p>The CTO is favoring testing over formative research. Why? They might be right in doing so; maybe that is what the company needs right now. Or they might not understand the value of one or the other. Or they might have a different understanding than you of the proper division of labor in the company. Or…a lot of things could be in play here; people have their reasons. But it'll be hard to influence the CTO or others unless you understand their reasons.</p>
<h2>2. Given the organization's goals and performance, what needs to change?</h2>
<p>What is the company trying to accomplish, and what are their results so far? Does the gap between what they want and what they are achieving (there is almost always a gap) suggest a particular course of action? Is this gap due to poor product/market fit, poor initial quality, churn, cost of support, customer time-to-value, customer payback time, something else? Each of these would suggest different areas of the product to attach and might require different research activities or emphasis.</p>
<h2>3. Who needs to understand the problem the way you do? Who are your allies? Who is your audience?</h2>
<p>Once you understand the CTO's reasons and the organizational situation you can determine if your idea about an intervention (more formative research) is sensible or not – whether or not it will contribute meaningfully to closing the results gap. But then you need to make it happen. And this requires deep knowledge of the organization: the people, the culture, and how change occurs. You may be in an organization where you can, armed with the above information, make a convincing argument to the CTO. You may be in an organization where you have to recruit like-minded people to surround the CTO. Or you may be in a place where convincing the CTO is less important than engaging the people who would be helped more directly by your intervention, the product managers.</p>
<p>We also talked about projects vs incrementalism, chain of command vs lateral influence, and allowing for serendipity in formative research, but those are topics for another time.</p>

<p>Naturally this has been met with many hot takes, including</p>

<p>bizarre, especially given that i have often heard the uk gov is a good example of taking accessibility seriously</p>
<p>[name redacted 2]</p>

<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if they consulted any screen reader users before they went with this somewhat condescending metaphor: &quot;Another way to make sure you are describing the image properly is to imagine that you're reading out the content of the page on a telephone. When you get to the image, what would you say to help the listener understand the point the page is making?&quot;</p>
<p>[name redacted 3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…as well as complaints that Gov.uk is &quot;canceling the alt tag&quot; and other alarmist conclusions.</p>
<p>Gov.uk's advice is actually pretty good, if a bit high-level.</p>
<p>We <em>should</em> provide alternate content for anything that is not text or cannot be read by a screen reader and that is important to the meaning of the page – for example, if the image were missing or broken the page’s meaning or intelligibility would be diminished – and should <em>not</em> provide alternate content for anything that can be safely left out without diminishing that meaning.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to provide alternate content; the <code>alt</code> attribute is one of them. It appears that <a href="http://gov.uk/">gov.uk</a> is expressing in part that the <code>alt</code> attribute is a less accessible way of presenting that alternate content than simply putting that alternate content right into the page, and that’s true: a person who needs the content in the <code>alt</code> attribute but doesn't use a screen reader (such as a person using a magnifier) will have to do some extra work to dig that content out of the <code>alt</code> attribute that a screen reader user would not need to do. That person would be helped if the alternate content were in the page, and no one else would be inconvenienced by this change.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Quotations are my words, all else are the words of my manager.)</p>
<h2>Revision to goals for the quarter</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Step into responsiveness via the design system – propose to R&amp;D why and a way forward to get us to accommodate actual user viewport sizes better, and get a resulting project onto the roadmap</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't have the strongest opinion on this one and bucket it similarly to chipping away at general UX improvements. I don't want to dig the hole deeper – anything net new we develop would ideally have a higher bar of usability prior to general release – but would need to see specific examples with LOE of more general improvement candidates to weigh in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improve the quality of UX delivery – establish Figma delivery conventions specifically intended to reduce the cognitive load on developers, with developer input and feedback, and pilot these new conventions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strongly agree with this one and I appreciate how Jon scoped the specific action item this quarter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advocate for an appropriate level of UX/UI polish to survive engineering delivery by spreading the UX review cycle currently piloted via Smart Alerts and Call Review projects to other teams/crews</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also in strong agreement here but with the most Q3 emphasis being on Call Review &amp; Coaching-related projects if we had to prioritize where Jon spends his time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advocate for and begin a project to do POC IAs for various user types to explore the sensibility and difficulty of separating [product A] and [product B]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We talked about modifying this one a bit as some of the groundwork on [product B] is in place. I let Jon know that I have a Q3 goal with [PM] to revamp the [product A] product vision/strategy which will surely need UX input as stakeholders and that ideally better defines where UX output can be helpful for [product A] future IA and candidates for usability improvement.​</p>
<h2>Values</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Light The Customer's Way</strong>: [evident in] the improvements we've made to UX quality in recent releases and stronger focus on customer adoption and usability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: Jon's involvement in many of the organizational &amp; process improvements we've rolled out in recent months, ensuring UX had a seat at the table ahead of making these changes and providing his perspective that influenced the solutions we implemented.​</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Past Quarter's Results</h2>
<p>Jon has done a fantastic job improving both the quality of UX output at Invoca and building buy-in for user/customer-centric activities. He receives positive feedback from cross-department stakeholders and I am grateful to have him leading UX efforts. Key examples of Jon's leveling up of UX in recent months:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>His participation at Dallas and May offsites, particularly the lead up to our leadership offsite and his help with material preparation and follow through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His very well-received Connect talk that summarized/connected the dots on many of the changes we had been looking to drive following our offsite discussions - trios, experimentation, shipping value/quality vs. speed, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveling up members on the UX team and helping define new shaping frameworks to set them up for success. Also, pushing the team to have more direct customer/user feedback sessions.I hope Jon recognizes how far we've come in a short time (no longer prioritizing by service area vs. customer needs) and I'm excited to continue the journey with him.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>​2 – Right On Track</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://getmatter.com/email/29711227/?token=29711227%3A6VAqDDvgDkVW6ill7qMdL_XynzM">This article is worth a read as-is</a>. But once you’ve done that, consider that our users are also suffering a form of the paper cut tax since they need to (and due to the tax are told to) see their CSMs about every little thing they want to change on the platform. Poor usability is a brake on their productivity and, in turn, a brake on their esteem for our company.</p>
<p>The story I am told regularly is that usability in existing interfaces hasn’t been addressed because it is hard to relate to ROI. That’s true. That also does not make it less important. As we do with other types of issues, I think we should devote a percentage of our collective effort to chipping away at the large experience debt we have in the platform.</p>
<p>A small but potentially high-signal example: yesterday a few UXers including me attended “Mastering the Basics,” a webinar meant to introduce new customers to a handful of typical operations on the platform. It was lengthy and dense, intelligibility issues were apparent (nay, obvious) at every turn, and two common refrains punctuated the talk: “see your CSM for help with this” and “remember, ‘campaign’ has nothing to do with your actual marketing campaign but refers to call treatment” (paraphrased). The latter was mentioned seven times in a short period; clearly it is a response to a problem.</p>
<p>I see “see your CSM for help with this” as an admission; “we know there’s a problem.” This is a sensible thing to say in our current state, and a bad look. “I’m sorry it is broken” is said. “We’re working on it” is not. “Remember, ‘campaigns’ has nothing to do with your actual marketing campaign but refers to call treatment” is also an unwitting admission: “this system wasn’t made for you and it is your problem to remember the odd words it uses.”</p>
<p>What would it take to, say, change “campaigns” to “call treatments?” Would the customers that actually use the term “campaigns” in this way be put out by such a change? Have we asked? Just a thought.</p>
<p>Incoming employees recognize the problem. When I sought feedback for M— recently, D— mentioned “…for the UX team a great emphasis can be made on owning the UX of the platform not just for the new initiatives but for the existing features.” We’d love to, and to do so we need your help and participation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com">Merlin Mann</a> is fond of saying &quot;you don't have to be nice, but you should be kind.&quot; In this statement &quot;nice&quot; refers to being agreeable, and &quot;kind&quot; to being friendly. These are not the same.</p>
<p>Men who prey on women depend on a woman's social conditioning to be nice, to be agreeable, AND to be kind, to be friendly, and in doing so put their target's desire for self-protection in conflict with their desire, often unconscious, to satisfy that conditioning. This is an extreme example but it illustrates the problem well; <em>nice</em> all-too-often becomes <em>self-negation</em>.</p>
<p>There's plenty of opportunity for self-negation in a business context; a classic example is making a request of a peer, and when that request is not fulfilled, not following up out of fear that you will be disliked.</p>
<p>In business, we are interdependent. We need things of others: of our superiors, of our subordinates, and of our peers. Without role power in play it is especially easy for our conditioning to be &quot;nice&quot; to trip up our interoperation with our peers. Not following up on an unmet expectation trains your peers that your requests don't matter. In effect you train others to ignore your needs if you do not consistently assert them. That's no way to be effective in your role. What's worse, it doesn't help your likability one whit.</p>
<p>So, start with a well-formed request: this is what I need, this is when I need it, this is why I need it. Thank the person for meeting that request. Follow up right away if it is unmet and negotiate a new deadline. Give the person context. Escalate as needed.</p>
<p>(You can skimp on the well-formed-ness of your requests once you've established trust that your wishes will regularly be met by this peer, in a timely manner, and that they will raise objections quickly and in good faith. Not before.)</p>
<p>Your kindness appears in these interactions when you do not interpret your peer's noncompliance as a personal attack. Your kindness is visible when every interaction, though your need has not been met, is pleasant and factual. Your kindness is made clear when you first escalate to your peer, then only if necessary escalate to a superior. Your kindness is exemplified when that escalation focuses on the unmet need first, and not the peer or your disappointment.</p>
<p>You don't have to be nice, but you should be kind. This means taking a charitable view of your peer's motivations and behavior, but nonetheless standing up for what you need, when, and why, and not letting things slide. You deserve to be effective in your job. And if you are kind, you are likely to be well-liked. Nice is not necessary.</p>

<p>I'm ready for my presentation! Or as ready as I'm likely to be. I have plenty of time to rehearse and do a little polishing. Accept the pressure to perform as a sign that you're excited and should prepare, then prepare. It took me a little longer than usual to get to this point, this time, but I'm here now.</p>

<li>
<p>Just when I'm worried I'm not accomplishing enough my manager points out that he's happy to see the progress I'm making. Phew.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The health scare has passed. That alone would be enough, <em>dayenu</em>. A little bit of this week was taken up by dealing with not having a good memory of what transpired the prior week. Even so,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simplification – as the SMS team learns more about the customers and how they can be helped with missed and after-hours calls, the proposed solution is becoming simpler rather than growing tentacles. That's a great sign; continued customer contact and analysis across those customers, rather than specific attention to any one of them, is driving this simplification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplification – learning about the sales process with another leader from R&amp;D is causing us to explore simpler ways of trialing our product. And we had a breakthrough idea this week that will further simplify what we are prototyping, mostly taking the actual product and its attendant complexity out of the picture. This'll be cheap to try and could lead in so many interesting directions that it's really exciting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teamwork – the UX team is swarming on a key set of usability and capability improvements for our growth product, and it's going well. The newest member of the team, from a design process and output standpoint, is running rings around one of the more senior members. It's nice to see the development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I stopped procrastinating on a thing, and now the thing is moving well.</p>

            <title>Quality, part two</title>

            <pubDate>Sat Jul 29 2023 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems like we have a pretty good grasp of what quality should be when it comes to infrastructure – what technical soundness is, how much load we should handle, what kind of logging, etc. but we are less mature regarding other dimensions of quality.</p>
<p>An interactive item in general availability, operated by customer users, should</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>be valuable to specific users</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>deliver value in results and conveniences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>minimize toil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and this should be verifiable by experiment and by monitoring success metrics/adoption rate/etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>be usable by those users</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>intelligible</p>
<ul>
<li>and this should be made more likely via concept testing, and somewhat verifiable by experiment and by monitoring success metrics/adoption rate/etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>obvious in expected actions and right action (design guideline)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>makes success obvious (design guideline)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>makes good use of familiar controls and interaction paradigms where possible (design guideline)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and this should be made more likely through user testing, and monitorable via success rate/time on task/error rate/etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>be complete in its states, messages, and errors (design guideline)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be instrumented so we can witness users’ successes and difficulties</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s some disagreement about how important interactive quality might be for infrequently-operated configuration tasks in the platform. The irony is that an infrequently-operated item is not practiced frequently enough by a user to be well-learned, so it must be <em>more</em> obvious in its operation than something they do every day. So to the above there’s pressure to add</p>
<ul>
<li>be self-explanatory, relying on recognition rather than training and recall</li>
</ul>
<p>For products in a growth phase, where catering to new users and bringing them to intermediate proficiency is arguably more important than catering to existing power users, “be self-explanatory, relying on recognition rather than training and recall” is also important for the most critical, central workflows.</p>
<p>Some attention to interactive quality is important even in experiments, since poor interactive quality can confound our measurements. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it is not usable we may not learn what we hope to learn from an experiment or a beta – since actual use will be hampered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is unpleasant to use, its uptake will be blunted unless the value strongly outweighs the problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is not visually credible, confidence in its function will be blunted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it contains needless toil it will be unpleasant, time on task will be high, error rate may be high.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some confounding factors inhere more strongly to “complete” features rather than experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it is incomplete in the intended use cases it will seem broken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is incomplete in its states, messages, and errors for the covered use cases it will seem broken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is not obvious it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is not self-explanatory it has poor usability and increases the cost of training, which is backward from what we plan to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is poorly-labeled it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general idea is that scope should scale but quality should not. All of these are achievable in small scopes and if we care about quality are not “extra” costs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was not an easy week. Several things went at least a little sideways: Tuesday's workout wrung me out; Saturday's was cut short by a whopper of a headache; I recognized that I've taken on too many projects; several people were out and despite all of our preparation that did cause some disconcert in projects; I procrastinated on a thing I really care about and made no progress on it all week. And yet there is gold among the sand:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A key project beset by inter-group politics, misunderstandings, and misapprehensions is seeing the politics die down and the plan emerge. And in response to a critical misunderstanding involving my team (no, while the key designer is out design capacity will not rise, but we do have a plan to maintain it and a plan to raise it further over time) a very nice meeting was had to negotiate scope. No voices raised, no disappointments even. Everyone played fair and it seems that everyone is happy with the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procrastinating on the thing I really care about that I procrastinated on made room for a handful of other needed things that, while not as important, helped me make progress on a few of the too-many projects. <a href="https://structuredprocrastination.com">Structured procrastination</a> FTW?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…and Thursday's lifts went up just fine, while the prior Thursday was a struggle with some of them not completed. Bodies, they are strange things.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a short week, and that brings danger that people will try to cram five weeks of meetings and activity into three. This happened, alas. Even so,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Giving people the (exceptional) option to skip critique or 1:1 for this short week provided a little relief to folks chasing urgent projects, even though few took advantage. (Schedule relief for those who did, psychological relief for those who did not.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A plan came together (with coaching, but that's fine) to distribute work among the team to keep things moving as people get into their suppertime time away from work. We'll have a smaller crew than usual next week but everything that needs to move will keep moving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the team getting the messages I'm sending more consistently, that superficial aesthetic variation is not interesting but informational and interactive design exploration, aimed at well-expressed informational and interactive goals, is? Yes, mostly. Not everyone all the way, but yes, mostly.</p>

<p>Disconcert between two teams is giving way to eagerness and collaboration. Three things I often talk about are helping us along:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>referring to real customer data,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>finding and negotiating common goals, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>humans remembering to relate to one another.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of the people I support are getting the message that attention to detail must be demonstrated. (In the details! Surprise.) This has required some tight feedback loops, but I think I'm successfully avoiding micromanaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mentorship is fun! I might have a new mentee, perhaps just for the duration of their job search.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Group coaching is valuable when the message is positive (&quot;I invite you to do this&quot;) and useful to all and there's no need to single someone out, or when singling someone out would be more pointed than the situation warrants. It allows the saving of face. Small issues such as not having the correct email signature, failing to make a fresh pot of coffee when taking the last cup, etc.</p>
<p>I used group coaching today when I pointed out to my team that, yes, the time slots in our weekly critique are short and it is hard to go deep, but I invite them to pursue feedback in other ways as well (and listed some ways). There were two people who needed that message the most, but it was relevant to all of them.</p>
<p>It's not the same thing as complaining to someone about problematic behavior, or escalating this complaint to their supervisor, which are more inherently pointed or even confronting.</p>
<p>We all wish that people would come directly to us individually for their wishes and corrections, but sometimes they are not sure they should, or don't want to confront, or are nervous about their skills in such an interaction, or don't want to make a big deal of it, or mention it in passing in more established relationships, or…myriad options.</p>
<p>(If you spend too much effort parsing the behavior of others you are likely to do the same for your own behavior, or vice versa, which will make it harder to relax and act in the moment. When I find myself stressed about how someone else's complaint came to me I try to set aside the manner and just focus on the content. Often there's at least a little something right in the complaint.)</p>

<p>Friday was meeting-light so I got a little bit of non-meeting work done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I realized that for a handful of the initiatives I'm on I needn't toil in obscurity but would do better to send async questions to a handful of people, so I did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A team-wide message from the CEO mentioned &quot;The transition to a multi-product company, the importance of AI, and strengthening the role of UX and front end engineering have emerged more clearly for me as priorities.&quot; – It's sinking in!</p>

            <title>Someone mentions "specialized enterprise users" in re accessibility</title>

            <pubDate>Thu Jun 15 2023 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a discussion of accessibility and the level of attention a company ought to pay to it, someone said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have always worked in complex enterprise software where the user is a specialized individual and not the general public so accessibility has never been stressed or pushed beyond considering the impact of colors and contrast.</p>
<p>I seek only to take down what they said, so I'll not name them here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This position is entirely understandable, and I suspect that most designers working in a B2B environment receive this excuse from their organizations when asking about those organizations' lack of attention to accessibility. Though it is understandable is also wrong-headed; a close reading reveals where.</p>
<h2>&quot;not the general public&quot;</h2>
<p>Note that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>many</em> of the impairments that make poor attention to accessibility a problem are _not_h less prevalent in enterprises than in the general population, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where there are differences in prevalence (for example, there are far fewer blind people in knowledge work jobs than in the general population) it’s due in part to lack of attention to accessibility in the tools used or the jobs themselves, making it hard for those people to take jobs that rely on those tools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, companies discriminate against their employees and potential employees by not providing accessible tools, and companies that provide such tools but ignore accessibility are complicit, perhaps even participatory, in that harmful practice.</p>
<h2>&quot;specialized individual&quot;</h2>
<p>&quot;Specialized&quot; does not mean &quot;without impairment.&quot; Just as it is wrong to assume that an unnamed doctor is a man, it is wrong to assume that a librarian won't have difficulty carrying books or a software developer won't have difficulty typing or reading a screen. But even folks without long-term disabilities may have, situationally or temporarily, impairments where they too would benefit from attention to accessibility and inclusive design. Witness the <a href="https://www.oxfordcc.co.uk/files/inclusive.png">very nice graphic</a> from the <a href="https://inclusive.microsoft.design/">Microsoft Inclusive Design Manual</a> that demonstrates that people may need accommodation for a permanent issue, due to temporary illness or injury, or due to seemingly unrelated life circumstances. Inclusive design helps all of these.</p>
<p>In this case, I'm not sure &quot;specialized&quot; is correct, even; typically, enterprise software is used by normal people with a normal level of specialness. We’re not dealing with thousands and thousands of Top Gun pilots here. The one way in which these users differ reliably from the general population is in <em>domain knowledge</em> relevant to their work, and even that domain knowledge is not evenly distributed. For example, I work with several systems in my job, and my level of expertise in each of them and the domain they operate in varies widely. I’m just not that special or specialized except in re a few of the many tools I use.</p>
<h2>And don't forget</h2>
<p>Many of the interventions we’d entertain to improve accessibility also improve usability for all users. So the sadly common thought that folks with impairments are special cases that require extraordinary effort for little return is also incorrect.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We heroically snuck up to Seattle by car late at night and then back the following night, thoroughly wearing ourselves out in the process. The traveling was exhausting and not fun, but…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>…the event itself, a surprise party for my mother’s 80th birthday, was a smashing success, thanks mainly to my sister-in-law, and…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…I spoke well at the party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple announced the 15” version of the M2 MacBook Air I just bought, and it’s about the same price. Return, purchase, new new machine! (That’s why this post is late – the new machine needed to arrive so I could fire up LocalWP and export the site. Yes, you’re looking at a Wordpress-powered site, but just a static export of it, no actual WP running on the server, ‘cause that’d be slow and hackable. One day I’ll replace this canned theme with my own simplified one, maybe.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A coworker suffering from burnout opened up to me and I was able to help somewhat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another coworker, this one skeptical of my department, brought me a project. We were able to quickly negotiate the scope and I have it in the hands of a capable designer who I’m sure will do a good job without gilding it or underdelivering out of an excess of hurry. I love it when a plan comes together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My chats about quality are starting to resonate, here and there. Plenty more to do, but it’s maybe sinking in.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I didn't do that, this time. I did many of the meetings, but skipped some in favor of actually making stuff. Highly recommended.</p>

<li>
<p>Huaraches for men for summer. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1286290385/brown-leather-shoes-for-men-made-in?ref=yr_purchases">They're fab</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>I went for a 400lb deadlift and didn't get it, so 375 max. That's fine…for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We heard of a problem we inadvertently introduced, proposed a fix, investigated the effect of the fix, and deployed the fix in the same day. That's definitely a step forward in customer-centricity.</p>

            <title>Authenticity and intellectual posture</title>

            <pubDate>Mon May 29 2023 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was talking with a mentee today when the topic of authenticity came up – if we are thinking so much about how we should behave, how do we know what is authentic? It seems like authenticity should be effortless – why is it so hard? (The below comments are only lightly specific to the mentee's situation.)</p>
<p>Authenticity does not mean being unfiltered, unmodulated, completely ego-expressive. Instead, we are behaving authentically when our actions and our motivations and our sense of self are aligned with one another.</p>
<p>Your physical posture is how you hold your body, arrange your limbs and whatnot, and that posture affects your comfort and your behavior. For example, slouching leads to back fatigue, reduced lung capacity, and feelings of &quot;being down,&quot; and the behavioral effects flowing from these physical effects. We remind ourselves to sit up comfortably straight in part because we genuinely want the positive effects that this posture will bring, therefore the posture is authentic – even though we had to remember to do it, taking that posture matches our motivations.</p>
<p>What are the intellectual and social/emotional analogs of physical posture?</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual posture</strong> – how you hold your mind/thought: What is an intellectual posture that makes you ready to consider the current tactical need, the comments of others, and the strategic situation without causing internal conflict? What is the intellectual frame you can put around what's happening to recognize the problem to be solved and your place in the solution? This is useful for your own well-being and effectiveness, and becomes visible to others through your behavior. Your behavior is authentic if it matches your actual intellectual posture, and inauthentic if these don't match. You change your intellectual posture in response to your motivations; if your motivations and posture match, the posture is (and your behavior will thus be) authentic.</p>
<p><strong>Social posture</strong> – how you hold your heart: when entering a situation at work or socially, what are you hoping will happen? What sort of interactions would you like to have? These wishes motivate your social posture. What is your role to play in achieving interactions of the sort you would like to have? What attitude do you portray as part of playing that role? This is your social posture. Your social posture and the behavior it fosters can be authentic or inauthentic; if the wishes and the posture and the behavior are all in alignment, then they are authentic.</p>
<p>You may not be able to be perfectly authentic all the time. It takes practice. It gets easier if you can bring your goals and posture to consciousness (e.g., if you can think about them, observe them, reflect on their effect on the recent past) and behave in a way that is congruent with them. Sometimes it's hard to get all three at once – but even struggling with these is authentic. Is it easier (even just a little) to model what you want at work or at home? Or even with just one friend? Practice where it is easier for a while.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much of the week was spent on-site, meeting with my R&amp;D leadership peers (and the thin layer of execs above us) to figure out what behavior should to change to change our results. Strangely enough, this group not met since well before I started, and much of the contact I've had with these people has been in 1:1s, small meetings, or in some cases not at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Naturally this was the first time at this job I've had that &quot;<a href="https://www.michaelvizdos.com/resources/first-team">first team</a>&quot; feeling, which has been long overdue. It's great that we were able to get from a little icy to working together openly in less than a day, the first day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the agenda was less agenda-like that I typically feel comfortable with, my main goals were to represent myself and my team well and to genuinely engage with the topics as a knowledgeable and connected member of the team. I think I did that, and so do several people I've checked with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last week I mentioned that a deadline helped me, &quot;having written and received helpful comments on many pages of pre-read material.&quot; It turns out that several months ago our CEO encouraged pre-reads as a way to accelerate meetings. Little did I know. But with this group it works; the discussion that happened in these documents meant that when we sat down together we had a basis of agreement and a pretty good understanding of where controversy remained, and could get into the substance quickly and without too much preamble. (This isn't the same as the Amazon method of bringing a document and reading it quietly together to start a meeting.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had my first &quot;quarterly coaching&quot; conversation with my boss, and it went better than I expected.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've shared this verbatim with my team and pointed out how it will affect our work in the coming quarter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon has done a great job ramping up on all things Invoca and focusing on building out the UX discipline and helping push us to be more customer centric.</p>
<p>Jon has balanced time improving processes/personnel within the UX group (for ex: instituting the weekly design critique meeting) and helping create the right conditions for UX to succeed with key stakeholders (primarily PM &amp; ENG leadership). I believe this overall area should continue to be Jon's Q2 focus while begining to take steps to evangelize and show off results of UX output to stakeholders. We discussed a few ideas such as Trios sharing/demoing their work in settings like Invocation, CKO, Company Connect. Jon &amp; team have also started using Lattice to publicly praise good work in Slack.</p>
<p>Other candidates for UX growth discussed:<br>
* Building out UX personas/profiles under 'business centers' - to be used both in product development and by the organization to be more customer-centric and raise the visibility of UX.<br>
* Building muscles as a trio and working projects in scoped iterations en route to GA vs. larger chunks shipped.<br>
* Removing barriers or reliance on PM/others for UX to get more direct interaction with customers; having UX lead respective customer sessions (and bringing insights back to the teams) vs. being in the passenger seat.<br>
* Jon &amp; team potentially spending more time learning the product in conjunction with projects and their focus areas in the platform.</p>
<p>I also want to call out the good work Jon has done building trust and goodwill with the 'First Team' in R&amp;D. I hope we can continue to focus on problems and improvement areas collectively (being open to sharing in the leadership Slack channel, etc) and use 1:1 discussions as warranted vs. the way to solve problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty good?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's common for non-design folks to assume that research and design rigor will slow the overall process down. (I've heard epithets such as &quot;constipate&quot; – unpleasant and rude.) How might the UX team contribute to speed of value delivery?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improving our understanding of our customers (and especially of our users) so that we can make better decisions about direction, scope, interactive details, etc. and especially things <em>not</em> to build. The fastest feature is one you don't build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that every design intervention is a response to a user or customer problem or a benefit that we are sure our customers will value. This is a subset of the above, but deserves special mention because a cool idea is <em>not actually cool</em> unless the person we hope to serve will appreciate the benefit it delivers enough to pay for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answering business questions through small doses (in pharmacology the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose_(pharmacology)">minimum effective dose</a>) of research, concept evaluation, and usability testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping to manage scope by offering simpler alternatives that users can use to possibly meet seemingly more complicated needs. This is sometimes the opposite of what UX is tempted to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncovering opportunities to improve usefulness and usability to improve adoption, retention, and time-to-value, which make the business itself faster and more efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delivering detailed designs, business roles, states, labels, etc. at an appropriate level of fidelity and no fancier, incorporating many elements only by reference to the design system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuously improving the design system so interfaces can be built faster and with greater consistency, and to steadily improve the usability, familiarity, and accessibility of capabilities delivered on the front-end.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was fielding complaints about slowness in the UX team's contribution to projects until I started talking to the people I support about this concept. Turns out it is good for anyone who works on a team, anyone who works with others.</p>
<p>When starting on or working on a project, I expect everyone to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>come to a project with a plan,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>share and negotiate that plan, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be conspicuous in fulfilling that plan, by</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>regularly offering work-in-progress for discussion (there's no such thing as &quot;not ready to look at yet&quot;),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly offering the status of current work,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly predicting when the current activity will be done,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allowing for the renegotiation of the plan, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>offering modifications to the plan as project or business conditions change (active renegotiation).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll note that the default mode here is active – actively planning, actively sharing, actively predicting, actively responding to change.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week was tricky motivation-wise; there's an onsite meeting coming up in two weeks that is very important and I'm nervous about the outcome. That's typically a recipe for procrastination. So</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I got four of five quarterly coaching sessions done (<a href="https://structuredprocrastination.com">structured procrastination</a> for the win).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We started a pilot to recruit prospective research participants; if this works we'll have significantly lowered one of our key barriers to user research. And if not, we can pivot and use the work that went into this pilot in other channels rather than having to start over. Planning your experiments in advance is good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got some pre-reads written for the meeting by starting them roughly and sharing prior to their completion. Near as I can tell this is going to produce a better overall result as these docs are already drawing useful comments, and people are aware that they are works-in-progress so there's no expectation that they are perfect expressions of what I think. Share early; it works!</p>

<p>By speaking freely about what I'm working on (for a change) I've found folks who are interested in the results, interested in the process, interested in helping, or who might combine their work and mine to make something even more interesting.

<p>Every Thursday I do a ladder of deadlifts – a couple light warmup sets, a handful of medium-heavy work sets, a heavyish couple/few reps, and a couple of legitimately heavy (for me) ones. I go double-overhand as long as I can, switching to a mixed grip once the bar starts to slip out of my hands. That used to happen around the end of the work sets; this week I got all the way to the final &quot;legitimately heavy&quot; set before having to switch grips. Getting better!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I finally managed to schedule some unpleasant diagnostic things I had been avoiding, a volunteer stint at the school district, shoulder PT, and close a lingering needless account by riding the momentum of just getting started. Just chipping off a chunk of a big problem and getting started is an underappreciated skill. (And it's astonishing how deeply broken the US healthcare system is even for someone as healthy as I seem to be.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people I support are visibly responding to my coaching. That's a win every time!</p>

<p>My &quot;plan&quot; has been reviewed by my team and my boss without much objection – time to double-check it for intelligibility and broaden the audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One conclusion of discussion last week is that there's widespread disagreement about how well we understand our users. This leads me to believe that the real answer is &quot;not very well.&quot; This is a win in that it makes they way forward much clearer. (There might also be some confusion around users versus customers here.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My boss' team meeting is about to get a lot spicier – he'll have some news as usual, but we're all expected to bring statuses (though <strong>not statusing</strong> (future article)!) and discussion topics. I'm full of that stuff, and it'll be good to have the opportunity to <strong>display accountability</strong> (future article).</p>

<p>While Swift syntax is distinctly weird to my &quot;C-like&quot; early Javascrip-trained eyes, plowing through the Apple-provided tutorials is helpful. Somewhat. Even so, the use/placement of dots in something like the following is distinctly odd to me:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>VStack() {
	Image(systemName: &quot;pin&quot;)
		.imageScale(.large)
		.foregroundColor(.accentColor)
	Text(&quot;Placeholder text for now&quot;)
}
.padding()
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, I'm team tabs.</p>

<p>The hackathon a few weeks ago was inspiring enough that I've started to learn a little but about iOS app development to fulfill a personal project. Since my last real coding experience was a bunch of kooky javascript stuff around the turn of the century I'm well out of my depth, but it's both fun and frustrating; there's a point at which I'm familiar, I'm familiar, I'm familiar with the concepts in a tutorial and then <em>whap</em> I'm met with something totally baffling.

<li>
<p>A coworker made their displeasure with the past UX regime abundantly clear in a group setting, and I decided I would not let it bother me. Even so, it did, for a bit. But later when we talked about it and I <strong>told them</strong> I had decided not to let it bother me, it <strong>actually</strong> no longer bothered me. It worked!</p>

<p>The enthusiasm is great but this level of shortcutting worries me. It's okay to ask ChatGPT to find things to read about a topic if you're fine with some of the results not being appropriate or even not existing. But I <em>don't</em> think it is fine to ask it how to do something or to perform research on your behalf. ChatGPT's emphasis is on delivering something that <em>looks</em> sensible, nothing more.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is not a <em>knowledge</em> model, it's a <em>language</em> model. If you'd like to dive into just how ChatGPT works, Steven Wolfram has a great explanation in his article <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/">What is ChatGPT Doing…and Why Does It Work?</a></p>
<p>The core idea is that ChatGPT is very good at figuring out what a very likely next word might be based on the prior words it has chosen, the prompt that it was given, and word frequency and proximity data derived from a huge amount of copy scraped from the internet. Since it doesn't actually <em>know</em> anything it does a great job of making plausible-sounding English ((ChatGPT can produce reasonable looking Python and other languages; a co-worker successfully asked it to return JSON in response to a bit of copy where someone asked for an appointment on a specific date and time.)) of the sort you might find anywhere on the net. Since the internet is the training data, the quality of the output is only about as good as the average quality of internet writing, which is not fabulous.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that there's <em>no attempt</em> to make sure that what ChatGPT returns is factually accurate. Bloggers and reporters experimenting with ChatGPT have accused it of making things up or &quot;hallucinating,&quot; but this complaint assumes that accuracy should be expected. It should not. ChatGPT is just trying to be plausible.</p>
<p>I'm not saying not to use ChatGPT. It's great as a memory jogger, or to avoid the tyranny of the blank page. It makes a perfectly shitty first draft that you can then do real work on. But if you just accept what it has to say you are choosing a below-average and likely nonsensical result. And if you use it as a substitute for doing the work that ChatGPT is simulating the output of, you are lying to yourself and others.</p>
<p>Since ChatGPT produces superficially plausible output, hiring managers are going to need to scrutinize a candidate's work more closely, and quiz a candidate more carefully. (Yes, we should already be doing this.)</p>
<p>On a Slack team I'm on there was a recent debate as to whether or not an engineering manager should accept ChatGPT output as the answer to a coding test, if during their regular duties a new hire would be allowed to use resources like StackOverflow, which often provides code snippets, Google Search, or even ChatGPT. What do you think, given the above?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I wrote two blog posts this week, and without waiting for the weekend. I find that I'll write a little explainer for someone in the normal course of business, mentoring, etc. and realize that it would make a pretty good short post. (This might be my main source of content.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've an idea for another quick post re the favorite topic these days: ChatGPT. People's un-ironic embrace of ChatGPT as a substitute for actually doing the work yourself is understandable but alarming. It's going to cause us to look at people's work a bit differently for a while. (Actually, an idea is only a win of you execute on it, because <a href="https://www.quotes.net/mquote/848858">ideas are cheap</a>.)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don't interrupt the user's natural behavior. Enhance or extend the natural behavior, but remain compatible with it.</p>
<p>While I worked for Belkin we made a remote-controllable plug-in switch module. You would plug this thing in to the wall and then plug a lamp or something into it, and it allowed you to control the lamp with your phone, turn it on or off, set a timer, etc. It was great, it sold pretty well, it was totally DIY-able, and pretty understandable. But folks who used it were ultimately lukewarm about it – they didn't love it. It interrupted the natural behavior of turning on and off the lamp. Instead of going to the stem of the lamp you had to either use your phone or push a button on the unit, which was at outlet-level on the wall. If someone turned the lamp off the old-fashioned way you could not use the unit to turn it back on without ALSO turning the lamp on the old way, blunting its usefulness.</p>
<p>A person has thousands of hours of practice turning on and off your lamp in the way it affords. And suddenly they and everyone else in their household needs to stop doing that and do some new, unfamiliar, and potentially awkward thing to just turn the lamp on or off.</p>
<p>Later we sold the same guts in a device that replaced a wall switch. People were much happier with this because there was nothing to get &quot;wrong&quot; – if someone pressed the wall switch to turn the light off, you could still operate it with the phone or as a normal wall switch. It fit naturally into people's existing behavior and enhanced it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you have a variety of potential solutions/designs how do you know which one(s) to choose to iterate on and which ones to discard?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ideal concept is something you can make without too much difficulty, delivers the intended benefit, is intelligible, leaves you open to future improvement, and has a ready way of witnessing success.</p>
<p>Typically you'll be working on a team with (or at least have a high level of contact with) someone in charge of the product (a product manager, usually) and someone in charge of engineering (a software architect or software engineer, usually) – with design this group forms the &quot;product trio.&quot; Each person on the trio has expertise in or evidence for some of the criteria by which you might evaluate concepts. With these in mind the negotiation of which concept (or what parts of which concepts) can begin. For example:</p>
<p><strong>UX</strong> – Is this concept intelligible to users, i.e. do they understand it and believe that it will deliver the desired benefit? Will this concept create a pleasant experience for the people we hope to serve? Does this concept use familiar interaction paradigms? Is this a concept we can build on later or will it need to be scrapped to add functionality? Can we partialize this concept if we need to reduce scope? Will we be able to detect whether or not people are successful in using it (e.g. by counting orders or conversions of some kind, or some other measure of user outcome)? Etc.</p>
<p><strong>Product</strong> – will this concept deliver the intended benefit? Is this concept strategically relevant? Does the cost/complexity fit our appetite to do the work? Does it seem intelligible to customers (who might be distinct from users)? Can we partialize this concept if we need to reduce scope? Can we add capabilities to this concept to improve it in the future? Will we be able to detect whether or not use of the concept is helping the business (e.g. by counting orders or conversions of some kind, or some other measure of business outcome)? Etc.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong> – is this concept feasible? Does it use data we have available or can get readily? Does it use technology and services we are familiar with or can learn readily? Does the cost/complexity fit our appetite to do the work? Does it lead us into an area we want to develop technically or to strengthen existing capabilities? Etc.</p>
<p>You can see some overlap. For example, the appetite question is PM + Engineering, for example. Customer and user intelligibility is PM + UX. There are others.</p>
<p>In an individual case study lacking these team members you will need to guess at some of these, or at least reveal your thinking about your concept selection.</p>

<li>
<p>This is the first week in quite a while that I fulfilled all of my at-work weekly objectives. Sometimes lowering your sights slightly can pay off. Yet I also feel I accomplished more than recent weeks. It's probably a combination of smaller, more accomplishable (therefore likely better-defined) objectives and actual progress on a thing that's been lingering for a while. We'll see if this is a trick or a technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having to explain my thoughts about product research/design/development to folks I work with, and having them ask me to operationalize parts of it they don't fully understand, has led me to explaining some of the concepts from new angles. This is challenging my thinking and helping me to firm it up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had a lovely chat with a person who is contemplating moving from designer to design manager. I find this sort of thing rewarding because I like helping, and I like meeting people, and because it reminds me of what I've learned, what I think, and to listen first. It's tempting to opine, but only valuable lightly and if that opinion is actually relevant to the person's situation or question.</p>

<p>It's downright <em>refreshing</em> to work for a company that doesn't reflexively look to &quot;try harder&quot; as the answer to its problems. It's nice to hear the CEO say that he doesn't think our problem is not stretching enough. (His assertion is that it's alignment we don't have enough of, and that's generally true also.)</p>

<li>
<p>Our first design critique (of the &quot;expected, not volunteered&quot; style that I favor) went great. I expect it will continue to go great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My wife and I have hatched a plan to get our remaining stuff out of storage that does not involve a supreme concentrated effort. Much like how I'd prefer companies make progress on major initiatives, we have a plan to do a little each weekend. This will help us move items, repack the ones that need repacking, and weed out things we no longer want to keep a bit at a time and get out of the storage unit by March. We've already transformed four boxes of books into two boxes to keep and two for the Friends of the Eugene Public Library's annual book sale. The lesson for everyone: you can get a lot done by</p>
<ul>

<p>getting started</p>

<p>One-on-one meetings in person, with folks I've only recently met and met only online, went fine. Well, even.</p>

<p>It was interesting to watch, over the course of a few days, our ideas about alternative travel emerge rise and fall in sensibility as conditions changed: roads closed, buses halted, trains canceled, airports shut…ultimately the tie between &quot;take the train&quot; and &quot;rent a car&quot; was decided by Amtrak taking longer to dry the flooded train tracks than CalTrans took to scrape the mud off of the 101. But…</p>

<p>…renting a car allowed us to give a ride to two team members, adding a positive to early disaster.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Do you have any suggestions for the management team?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you make a decision, tell us. Better yet, tell us right away and tell us why, <em>especially</em> if that decision reverses a prior decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please consider different/additional business models for the consulting business. I wrote a bit about this in my prior review and shouldn’t repeat it here except to point out that it is apparent to me that the strict hourly model places a lid on profitability, quality, and employee engagement in the work. That's probably necessary to point three below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please consider how to make compensation and benefits more competitive. I also wrote about this in my prior review. I’ve since realized that this is not just a competitiveness problem; it is also an equity and inclusion problem.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time I said “there also are numerous small compensation-related disappointments that I’ve mostly gotten over” — I was wrong about that. A few of them have run their course and no longer affect me directly; these are PTO accrual from zero, no benefits until well over one calendar month plus the month of start has elapsed, no profit sharing after a cutoff date rather than prorated profit sharing after a cutoff date, no key to the office for the first month. These will remain disappointments to new hires and in one case (benefits delay) is distinctly family-unfriendly.</p>
<p>No holidays is a real problem, as it takes fifteen days of PTO and makes it behave like eight. Eight days are VERY easy to consume and exceed in a year’s time, and folks in young families, with elderly parents to care for, or with disabilities or medical concerns are likely to burn through this allowance rapidly and find both their earning potential and ability to recharge harmed as a result. This is (unintentionally) as anti-diversity as it could be, as the least likely to be negatively affected are unattached young men followed by men in multi-earner households.</p>
<p>We’ve since learned from our research interviews with Directors and VPs that low offers plus lack of holidays is also a distinct brake on hiring, as they are a double blow to total compensation. We’re in a competitive environment where parity with local employers is no longer sufficient (and are we sure we meet even that standard?).</p>
<p>All the more reason to examine the business model or add additional business models to our portfolio.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back to work! Back to school!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I had good workouts this week. I'm going heavy, pushing the intensity, and I can tell the day after, but it's not coming with the little injuries and issues that it once did. I'm adapting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I let my diet go a bit (a bit?) during the holiday break and have not been that quick to come back to plan, but things are fine. I could do better at getting enough protein, and my discipline with sugar is a bit off, but nothing terrible. I've noticed that unless I need to report my diet to someone it's a lot harder to keep up with logging, and thus staying on plan. It doesn't make rational sense, but it makes emotional sense. Renting accountability is a thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The good meetings with good people at work continue – including a refreshing chat with the CEO. I remembered to ask him how <strong>he</strong> would notice if I accomplished the transformation we are hoping for, and he had an answer <strong>and</strong> a promise to think more deeply about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The real question will be whether or not this transformation and the attendant results are contradicted somehow by coming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR">OKRs</a>. Since the company is new to OKRs there's widespread fear that each important thing that should be done will be crowded out if it doesn't directly and strongly map to an OKR. The reason this is a win is that it represents the company trying to <strong>focus</strong> more, which is better than the all-too-common alternative to <strong>try harder</strong>.</p>

It's stuffed with enjoyable details like the refrigerator, tilting table, folding rear seat, cooktop, and boxer engine.</p>

<p>I moved portfolio items to this site and dropped the other host. It all looks like a dog's breakfast at the moment, but phase one of my &quot;online presence improvement project&quot; is thus under way.</p>

<h2><strong>What are the top three accomplishments you want to celebrate this review cycle? (Please include specifics: dates, outcomes, team members, metrics/data)</strong></h2>
<p>I had a handful of goals and subgoals since starting. Some of these I have been successful in.</p>
<p><strong>Increase UX Design capacity to meet demand</strong>, which meant</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Seek temporary capacity from known good sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hire for open positions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish job descriptions and UX career ladder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjust hiring process to be more rapid</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I did all of these over the course of one and a half quarters, though we later lost three of our six designers and are back near where we started (one to another role, one to health issues, and one to performance and budget). So this is both an area of accomplishment and an area for improvement, as I have two positions that remain open at this moment.</p>
<p><strong>Review and approve &quot;One Look&quot; style guide</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that our pattern library was not in a coherent or approvable state and we needed to pick up the pieces. So I allocated some capacity to it, coached [person] in how to proceed, and we've since adopted it as a team even as it continues to improve. It'll always be a work in progress, but we hear that at least two engineering teams are starting to share components based on our work there. Short of a CTO-level initiative to change coding practices this is about as good a result as we could hope for – engineers seeing the value and taking initiative. We also have POs interested in the contents of the pattern library as they look over the engineering team’s work and seek to provide better guidance and checking that things are made well.</p>
<p><strong>Recruit to begin establishing UX Research capability</strong></p>
<p>I was successful in this goal until it was withdrawn for budget reasons. It involved</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Writing our first research job description and including research functions in the career ladder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coaching and calibrating internal recruiting to find the right sorts of candidates</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We got to the point where we found a great candidate and made an offer! But it was not to be, budget-wise.</p>
<h2><strong>What are three areas you could improve based on your performance during 2021?  (Please include specifics: dates, outcomes, team members, metrics/data)</strong></h2>
<p>I could be more effective in <strong>driving the accessibility of our products</strong>. This isn't an area that has a single owner – the responsibility and activities necessary to do a good job here are distributed over PM, design, engineering, and QA. Our organizational temptation is to assign a single owner, but what we really need are champions in each of the necessary disciplines, who are charged with working together to adjust our behavior end-to-end. This will be an ongoing effort, but I hope to make major progress in 1H. First step: gather champions.</p>
<p>I would like to devote more attention to <strong>adapting UX deliverables to better meet engineering needs and better foster experience quality</strong>. This will help with the above accessibility push. This will be an ongoing effort, but I hope to make major progress in 1H. This will involve enlisting the individual designers, their PO counterparts, and their tech leads to discuss what they are receiving, what it lacks, and what it doesn’t need, and experimenting with adjustments.</p>
<p>I wish I had made more progress <strong>driving usability testing as a habit</strong>. I've chipped away at procedures, recruiting. tooling, buy-in, etc. but we have not made it over the hump yet. This will be an ongoing effort, but I hope to make major progress in Q1. I'm currently working on getting an unmoderated testing tool so that we can accomplish tests asynchronously.</p>
<h2><strong>Our mission is foundational to what we do.  How has your  work contributed to our mission?</strong></h2>
<p>I regularly re-orient discussion of our products' features, new work, and remediation toward discussion of <strong>who it is for, what scenario they are in, what goals they have, and how we can best help with those goals</strong>. As I seek to improve our processes and overall experience quality in an effort to deliver economic value to the business and to our customers, I have a specific focus on <strong>improving our level of user contact and our attention on burden</strong>. This should make it easier for the above discussions to be successful. (Burden is not specifically mentioned in the mission, but in materials surrounding it, and we have chosen burden reduction as a key component of fulfilling the mission.)</p>
<h2><strong>Please reflect on your activities this year and provide examples of how you have contributed to our values of Integrity, Inclusion, and Innovation during the review cycle?</strong></h2>
<p>&quot;Contributing to values&quot; is all about <strong>embodiment</strong> and <strong>modeling</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> – by which we mean honesty and strong ethical principles</p>
<p>I model for others being clear and communicative, dealing the good news and the bad, not hiding, and bringing thoughts and feelings to consciousness in the moment. An example of this is leaping into both communication and action once I realized that I had deleted the PM area of Confluence. I also help the people I support act with integrity by discussing their overlapping and conflicting motivations and helping them reframe these into a clear course of action with integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion</strong> – by which we mean recruit/engage/retain diverse and empowered teams</p>
<p>I model for others an appropriately accommodating, empathetic, and observable-fact-based approach to supporting employees and peers, including guiding others to consider and deal effectively with the emotional components of business conversations. I have pressed recruiting to make sure we are casting a wide net, and have offered job boards to post on meant to improve the diversity of our applicants. I examine my own responses to candidates for evidence of unconscious bias. I exhibit genuine positive regard for all those I support.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation</strong> – by which we mean creating value for customer and company</p>
<p>Our definition of innovation is, I think, too narrow. More traditional definitions of innovation involve introducing new ideas or methods. Improving our level of user contact will allow us to change our organizational behavior to better deliver quality through research-supported benefits-driven epics, concept generation and testing, and usability testing. I regularly relate difficulties our company faces to things I've learned or read elsewhere, seek new input from outside the company, and involve others in considering multiple ways forward for any challenge.</p>
<h2><strong>What are your goals for 2022? (Please include specifics: dates, outcomes, team members, metrics/data</strong>)</h2>
<p><strong>Drive the accessibility of our products</strong></p>
<p>This will require us to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Complete training of UX team on accessibility topics by end of Q2 for existing employees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer relevant accessibility training to engineering and product teams in Q1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with QA to establish what accessibility details need to be defined in stories and what are to be handled by common test cases by the end of Q2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop the habit of meeting this agreement by the end of Q3</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adapt UX deliverables to better meet the needs of the engineering team</strong></p>
<p>This will require us to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Examine engineering needs and adapt design deliverables to be lightweight yet complete, having discussed goals and experimenting with changes by end of Q2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drive adoption and further improvement of the pattern library, ongoing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain agreement with POs about which acceptance criteria need to come from UX and what are the POs’ responsibilities, by the start of 2H</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improve level of user contact team-wide</strong></p>
<p>This will require us to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increase level of research <strong>outside of</strong> Customer Advisory Boards (CABs) in products that have UX involvement: at least one non-CAB research activity per month per product by start of 2H</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make usability testing a habit in products that have UX involvement: at least one test round per “UX needed” epic by end of 2H except where change is experientially trivial</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improve the integration of the product content team into design, development, and go-to-market activities</strong></p>
<p>This will require us to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Catalog product content deliverables and their goals in Q1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish division of labor with customer success and modernization teams in Q2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refine delivery process and its reporting in Q3</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contribute to the globalization of our products</strong></p>
<p>This will require us to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Work with [person] to establish requirements around commonly-localized data formats, ongoing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document commonly-localized data formats in the pattern library, ongoing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish, with he help of engineering, a format and process to manage microcopy (so that it is catalogued, available for translation, investable by engineering, and standardized) and by the end of the year</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started my new job on Monday. It's nice to see good people working hard on <em>not too many</em> products, with a leadership team working to further narrow their focus and transmit that focus throughout the organization. It's a refreshing difference from every job I've had in the past. Yes, leaders will tell you that this is important, that they <em>want</em> to do this, that as a manager <em>you should</em> do this, yet so often it does not get done.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I've been included right away in some leadership-level discussions and workshops. This is as expected, but helpful nonetheless. There's allowance for getting acclimated but no expectation that I wouldn't be ready, which is great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's a lot I have to learn about the products we're working on, but people seem eager to help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the people I've spoken to so far have been relatively unvarnished about their thoughts about design and research, my team, the products, unexploited opportunities, and the results they hope for. This has helped me draft my received priorities quickly, and even if these are a little bit wrong it's a good place to start as I diagnose the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The girl is dancing in nine performances of The Nutcracker this year, playing six different parts in different shows. Her hard work and resolve to perform more is paying off and I couldn't be more proud of her.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first week is in the books!</p>

<p>The new job begins on Monday! I have a new computer, it's not overly locked-down, and the tech onboarding process was smooth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have formed a plan for the merger of my blog and portfolio, based in part on my earlier research about recruiters and hiring managers (win: having done the research!). Best of all it's not something I need to do all at once (win: planning and partializing!). There are several segments of this project that are useful on their own, and I've already done one of them. (UX people, turn your powers on yourself!)</p>

<li>
<p>They chose <em>you</em> to make an offer to rather than other applicants, so there's something they like about <em>you</em>, something they are excited or hopeful about – what is it? If you can find out what it is it should be straightforward to prove them right in their choice of you.</p>

<li>
<p>Name the problem specifically</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been American Thanksgiving this week, and we hosted due to local family either having smaller places or being in the midst of a remodel.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We managed to get nine around our table, in our small dining area, responsibly comfortably. The choice to roast smaller chickens rather than a big turkey, worked well. Everything was good, and the leftovers are good, and any anxieties I had about hosting and making were unfounded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I received a job offer just before the holiday and it set my mind at ease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the competing jobs I'm interested in are much earlier in the process, and thus cannot be seen as competitors to the offer simply because of timing, it's nice to have been considered by multiple firms at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interview process, much like other discussions, reminded me what I think about certain things that are article-worthy. I can move some of my interview prep almost directly to this site, and will do so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So it looks like I'll accept this new offer on Monday and then be on the <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-one-about-the-pro-leisure-circuit/">Pro Leisure Circuit</a> until December 12. Yay!</p>

            <guid>/_posts/2022/11/27/i-was-asked-what-kind-of-leader-are-you/</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat Nov 26 2022 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During my recent (and successful) series of interviews one interviewer asked me &quot;what kind of leader are you?&quot; I blurted out &quot;supportive,&quot; not having really quite prepared for that sort of question, and while it's true, I didn't find that answer satisfying – support is not all that I provide, though I find it important. So I resolved to do better in alter interviews. This topic came up as a prompt for a final presentation to a panel of interviewers, so I chose four adjectives and presented those. (Any one of these topics could be an article unto itself.) A slightly cleaned-up version of what I had to say appears here:</p>
<h2>Supportive</h2>
<p>I don't really talk about people as &quot;my employees&quot; or &quot;people who report to me;&quot; I like to think of designers, researchers, writers, etc. as &quot;the people I support.&quot; The people commonly thought of as individual contributors are the hands and feet of the organization, doing the actual work that our users and customers will interact with, and they need the path cleared to do their work as best they can.</p>
<p>I typically have a weekly 1:1 with each person I support, time specifically set aside for me to support them. And I try to create the conditions for the people I support to be mutually supportive as well.</p>
<p>One way this occurs is by having weekly design critique, prefaced by my giving the team whatever &quot;news&quot; I've gathered from the company. Critique is not about design approval; it's really time to borrow the  brains of other team members for help working on whatever you are working on, and the teams where I've put it in to practice have, over time, come to seek each others support outside of critique, have been more aware of what is going on on other teams, have borrowed good thinking from each other, and have in general started to converge in terms of the experiences they are producing. This works remote or in-person; at Cayuse most of the folks on the team had never met in person. (A good design system and pattern library helps with this too, of course, and while someone should be in charge of it, it's worthwhile to have multiple individuals chew on it and take pieces to work on.)</p>
<h2>Adaptive</h2>
<p>In order <strong>to improve our results we need to change our behavior</strong>. &quot;Try harder&quot; is not typically an effective strategy. There are a great many ways we might need to adapt:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We might need to add capabilities by bringing in people who have these capabilities, or through training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We might need to encourage existing behaviors through process changes, internal metrics, or incentives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We might need to change which people work together when.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We might need to address specific interpersonal issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When <strong>something isn't going quite right my first questions are not about who, but what is our goal</strong> and what activities are contributing to that goal or detracting from it. When I arrived at Cayuse, several product managers largely gathered feedback from customer advisory boards, and many on those customer advisory boards were not frequent users. Some weren't users at all. And the designers basically punched out UI based on very specifically-written stories with little or no user contact. Both designers and PMs needed to be pushed toward alternate research methods, especially user interviews, so I pointed out what sorts of activities went with what parts of the Cayuse process, and gave trainings on interviewing intended to lower the barriers to actually doing interviews. Here’s how to plan, here’s how to schedule, here’s what to do in awkward situations, etc. And it worked! In the Risk Management, Inventions, and Animal Procurement teams that were only doing CABs, they started doing interviews to investigate specific capabilities they were working on, leading to more meaningful debate and decisions that could actually be explained to upper management.</p>
<p>We also might need to <strong>adapt when it comes to the data we seek</strong> – Belkin and Cayuse both neglected support contacts for a time. Cayuse is still wrestling with how best to use NPS comments, and for now ignoring customer forum discussions as a data source. Some orgs look for &quot;north star&quot; metrics when they really should start by counting basic user successes.</p>
<p>I'm also a little bit <strong>skeptical of &quot;best practices&quot;</strong> – when people speak of &quot;best practices&quot; it sounds to me a lot like copying. Being informed by what others have done, and experimenting, piloting, adapting, is great. But if you just copy your not learning.</p>
<h2>Communicative</h2>
<p>I debated whether to call this &quot;communicative&quot; or &quot;connective&quot; – to be most effective, <strong>people need to to know what's going on in the organization</strong>, how their work contributes to the success of the product they’re working on and the org as a whole, and why we are making the decisions we are making. They need to be plugged into feedback and data coming from real users and real customers. They won't act in an <em>empowered</em> and <em>accountable</em> way until they are able to make decisions, however small, in an <em>informed</em> way. That's why critique starts with the news, for example.</p>
<p>I'm fond of a &quot;one page strategic plan&quot; approach to ensuring that our <strong>adaptations are chosen to support our goals and our strategy</strong>, and I share this thinking and let people help with it. In a one-page plan, each strategic objective is broken down further and further until we get to concrete activities. Generally you’ll find that some activities feed multiple objectives and are thus especially valuable. The important part here is that by going through this exercise we can arrive at a prioritized set of initiatives to improve how we work and the quality of that work, arriving at that plan is done in public, and the plan is available for review so that when we aren’t thinking straight we can recall what we were thinking when we were thinking straight.</p>
<p>It's essential that the <strong>people needed to make a decision get together</strong> to make the decision. There are many forms of &quot;get together&quot; but I'm especially fond of product trio, where the key product person, key technical person, and key design person make decisions together. If push comes to shove the product person owns the product, but the main idea is to avoid ill-informed decisions that invite revisiting immediately. I can’t tell you how many times a designer has come to me complaining that “the plan changed again” when the underlying issue was that the right people were not together, leading to an unstable decision, or an opinion being taken as a decision.</p>
<p>I also like to <strong>evaluate design in terms of themes</strong>, and to make sure we are all aware of and supportive of these themes. The experience quality themes from Cayuse are likely different than the themes we will arrive at with Invoca.</p>
<p>It's also essential that in general we <strong>communicate in terms of goals</strong> rather than just instructions. I try to model this whenever I can. Instructions describe one way to meet a goal. It's helpful to know what we are doing, but it's essential to know WHY as we will need to adjust at some point and it's easy to choose the wrong adjustment if you don't have the goal firmly in mind.</p>
<h2>(Judiciously) Innovative</h2>
<p>There are good places and bad places to innovate. But what do we mean by innovation? I like the IDEO definition, which is simply &quot;introducing new ideas.&quot;</p>
<p>In general, I think <strong>we do NOT want to innovate in interface design</strong>. We want to make something understandable, usable, useful, informative, branded, and pleasant. People learn about how software works by using software. Thousands of hours of other people’s software. We don't need to be boring but we do need to be familiar.</p>
<p>We <strong>may want to innovate as we improve our processes</strong>. It's good to be informed by what has worked elsewhere, but let's not copy from others, let's learn from others and adapt.</p>
<p>I DO think we need to <strong>innovate when we are exploring</strong>, thinking about how to solve a problem, coming up with concepts. And we especially need to introduce new ideas when a concept is too clever or fancy to be cost-effective. We can think of our interventions on a scale from the simplest thing that could possibly work to too fancy for the ROI, and the right concept for today is somewhere on that scale, often a little lower than we'd expect. We may need to introduce new ideas to make something satisfying and effective that takes us down that scale to the right level.</p>

<p>My practice of doing at least one thing each day for the three topics of network cultivation, opportunities (warm and cold applications, reviewing job boards, targeted networking), and evidence (resume, portfolio, profile, articles) is keeping me moving forward and busy without frazzle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fear of doing a poor job on portfolio updates has finally been overwhelmed by the fear of not having done enough. It's a bit tricky as I left one job without gathering visuals and that company no longer exists. It's a bit complicated by the fact that at my prior job nearly all of the team's effort went into rewrites that have not yet shipped, so have not borne results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of my target companies are going through layoffs right now, but there are plenty of other opportunities out there. I just need to keep hammering, and the iron will become hot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you search the web for &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=double+diamond">double diamond</a>&quot; you'll find a great many articles describing a design or product management or product development process in which you</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>choose what to build</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>discover – gather insight into the problem area(s)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>define – express the area to focus on as a distinct selected problem</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>then build it well</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>develop – generate potential solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deliver – make and ship a potential solution</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people call this &quot;build the right thing&quot; and &quot;build the thing right.&quot; &quot;Discover&quot; and &quot;develop&quot; are meant to be generative, expansive processes, and &quot;define&quot; and &quot;deliver&quot; are meant to be specifying/selecting/contracting processes. This puts an expansion and a contraction in each of two phases, hence the diamond shapes. There are two phases, hence &quot;double diamond.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="images/Double-diamond.png" alt="As we discover we expand. As we define we contract. Develop expands again, and deliver contracts."></p>
<p>One of the reasons that the double diamond fails to satisfy is that it expresses each activity as either an expansion, a generation of ideas, or a contraction, a selection among those ideas. Generation and selection are important, and the way a team needs to think while generating is different than while selecting, but there's much more to do than just generation and selection. The dirty little secrets of the double diamond are that it</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>misses the relatively linear work of actually producing a solution, even as a test,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expresses the informative first phase, the research inherent to &quot;discover,&quot; as an expansion, which it might only accidentally contain,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>skips a step where you select among the available solutions in an informed way to get to where you can actually work on and ship one of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I happen to think of a UX process in <a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/10/22/the-bones-of-my-emerging-philosophy-of-ux-research-and-design/">three horizons</a> or phases. (Already we are off the double diamond.) Each of these contains some learning and some making. The learning might inform us (not necessarily expansion) or it might help us select (contraction). The making might be generative (expansion) or it might be adding specificity (contraction). So in each phase there's some expansion and contraction going on, each pair making a <em>single</em> diamond.</p>
<p><img src="images/Single-diamond.png" alt="The single expansion of &quot;generate&quot; and contraction of &quot;select&quot; is preceded by an &quot;inform&quot; phase."></p>
<p>(This three-phase approach actually maps somewhat closely to the <a href="https://www.designkit.org/human-centered-design">Ideo Human Centered Design Process</a>, consisting of inspiration, ideation, and implementation.)</p>
<p>If you search the web for &quot;single diamond&quot; you'll find a lot of gemstones. But this basic idea of informing/immersing, then generating, then selecting, maps quite nicely onto a general creative process that humans already naturally go through if they are adept at creating.</p>
<p>If you watch trained professional designers work, those that do not rely on inspiration or deadline panic, you see this process in action. They learn about the space in which they are working, they switch off the evaluator and cheaply/quickly make lots of diverse possibilities, many of them not very good, then they shift into evaluation mode and choose among the possibilities those that are worthy of improvement or delivery. A ton of that generated work is discarded, but the resulting item or items are much better for having gone through this process. Immersion, generation, selection. I've witnessed the process many times, but especially among industrial designers at Medtronic and Belkin, nearly all of whom were trained at Art Center, Long Beach State, or RISD.</p>
<p>If you watch adept <em>untrained</em> designers, the same thing typically happens. They take a number of rough stabs at the work before choosing a direction to go. They may already be immersed in the space in which they are working they generate, then they select. it took me a while to adopt this process, but my own work and the work of the people I support is much better for it.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens when jazz musicians improvise. First, they immerse themselves in the space in which they will be improvising by rehearsing the underlying tune and by playing scales in harmony with different passages of the piece. They then practice improvising within and around the harmonic structure of the piece for many hours, experimenting with sounds and passages. While practicing improvising the evaluative part of their thinking is muted, but as they continue they amass a vocabulary of musical fragments that they like, chosen from the many that they have created. And when it comes time to perform, they have the selected fragments at their fingertips. Immersion, generation, selection.</p>
<p>Meanwhile designers whose work isn't very good, or who are in a rush, or people taking a stab at designing who don't understand design, often make one or two crucial mistakes. Some tend to skip the inform/immerse art of the process, meaning that they'll come up with solutions that are poorly-informed, not well-suited to the problem at hand. Some try to generate and evaluate at the same time, and end up coming up with one maybe passable solution that's not nearly as good as they would have made had they generated for a while without evaluation.</p>
<p>(The second mistake is similar to what happens if you are brainstorming and someone is shooting down ideas during the meeting. The evaluation interferes with the generation, and little of value is actually created.)</p>
<p>Immersion, generation, selection. It's the basic form of the creative process.</p>

            <title>Philosophy of UX research and design: Horizon three (benefit)</title>
            <link>/_posts/2022/11/09/philosophy-of-ux-research-and-design-horizon-three-benefit/</link>
            <guid>/_posts/2022/11/09/philosophy-of-ux-research-and-design-horizon-three-benefit/</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue Nov 08 2022 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned earlier that I think of UX research and design practice in three horizons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Horizon one, detail</strong>: creating detailed designs, testing those designs, preparing for shipping, supporting development, instrumentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Horizon two, concept</strong>: generating and selecting among concepts intended to deliver a chosen benefit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Horizon three, benefit</strong>: learning about the problems people face and the benefits we might offer them to alleviate one or more of these problems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal in horizon three is to</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>understand the people we intend to serve, the work they are doing, and the difficulties that they face so well that we can</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>come up with multiple benefits we might offer these people, then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>select among these according to their value to these people and to the business.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To do this we have a handful of <strong>learn</strong> activities and a handful of <strong>make</strong> activities, in a learn/make/learn sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learn</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Examine about how people work in the domain in which we operate to detect difficulties or gaps in the experience (you'll recognize this as qualitative research), via</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interviews</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job shadowing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer advisory boards/focus groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surveys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure how people use the product now, or alternatives to your product if you don't have a product yet (you'll recognize this as quantitative research), via</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Testing existing experiences – summative testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reviewing sources of experience data</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>User success metrics and other user behavioral metrics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support contacts themes and details</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frequency of error messages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reviewing sources of user opinion data</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ratings and reviews</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer complaints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Net Promoter scores and comments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Generate a list of potential benefits – results that are desirable that don't mention the specific manner in which these results are delivered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Express each benefit in a way that works for your business, be it a benefit statement, a value proposition, a magical prototype, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check each benefit for strategic fit – would deliver this benefit help us with our chosen strategy, or distract from it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check each benefit for product fit – would delivering this benefit strengthen the product's value proposition, or dilute it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examine each benefit with the help of the people you serve – to what extent would having this benefit appeal when compared with competing benefits? How well would this benefit address existing complaints or difficulties? Would this benefit encourage subscriptions, renewals, purchases? There are numerous tools to do this, including max diff survey, dot voting, landing page testing, crowdfunding, and many others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of this you'll have one or more high-scoring benefits and likely will already have gathered some ideas about how you might deliver each one. You're ready for horizon two, concept.</p>
<p>You can see that this phase is an example of a <a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/11/09/single-diamond-the-basic-form-of-the-creative-process/">single diamond creative process</a>, where we inform ourselves, generate multiple possibilities, then winnow down the possibilities into a select few that we think will be especially good.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Over the past week I've noticed the stream of well-wishers, recommenders, and referrers continue. This reminds me that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have a bigger and better network than I give myself credit for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of those relationships have been surprisingly resilient (as I've not been the best about keeping in touch in most cases)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people who have been recommending me have been recommending me for largely the same traits and activities. So these traits are real, and I can use this fact to let impostor syndrome calm down a little bit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a second flood has begun – little tidbits that would be useful fodder for this blog or LinkedIn posts are becoming more apparent to me, and more often. I'm still wrestling with the &quot;what does the portfolio of a director look like&quot; issue, but I hope to have that sorted out soon, and I bet it will involve talking about how to get the work done more than the work itself..</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>A small incident today reminds me of the importance of explaining not just <em>what</em> action you'd like taken but <em>why</em>. I have found this to be true so often that it's become part of how I usually communicate with coworkers, supervisors, even my own family.</p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>The message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need either a new sewer outlet hose and a carrier to match, or just a new sewer outlet hose. Would prefer a longer hose and the ability to carry it. If using the existing carrier, there's a bolt missing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>became, through the telephone game</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longer sewer outlet hose with carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the work done merely</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Replaced two missing screws from carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with the note</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently has 47&quot; hose carrier, only has max 62&quot; space for different carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>missing the (completely accomplishable) goal entirely.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In August we took our little Airstream on a two-week trip from Oregon to Navajo country then back through some of the national parks of northern Arizona and southern Utah. It was an amazing trip, but we had a variety of mishaps with the trailer along the way. High winds carried off our radio antenna, we struggled with a blockage in the sewage tank, the toilet valve started to leak (not in a gross way), we lost a rivet inside, the awning started to spring back sluggishly and then not at all, we blew out a backflow preventer leading to a flood of fresh water coming out from behind the kitchen cabinet, etc. And in the very last days of the trip our 12-year-old sewer hose finally started to crack, leading to a small but unpleasant situation when we went to dump our waste water.</p>
<p>Naturally, once we arrived home we cleaned things up as best we could and made an appointment with our local service provider. Once I started to explain our list of issues they smartly asked me to email the list, which I did, explained in detail.</p>
<p>The drop off day arrived, and I dutifully explained each issue to the service writer, who had prepared a repair order based on the email. The service writer said he thought my explanations, email, and the repair order all made sense, and I handed him the keys.</p>
<p>Weeks passed, and I received a call saying the repairs were complete. We made an appointment for me to pick up the trailer.</p>
<h2>That brings us to today</h2>
<p>Today was pick up day, but I returned home empty-handed. All of the repairs were done satisfactorily but one: I had neither a new sewer hose nor a carrier to match. All that was done was to replace screws needed to hold the existing carrier in place.</p>
<p>Looking over the repair order, line two had only the instructions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longer sewer outlet hose with carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those aren't bad instructions, actually. If they had been fulfilled, I'd have taken the trailer home. Instead, the trailer still had the original hose and carrier.</p>
<p>Apparently the next size hose carrier is 64 inches long (162.5 science units) and there was only 62 inches of unobstructed space across the trailer to install a carrier, so the technician spotted and fixed what they could see as wrong, missing screws. They took a note to this effect</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently has 47&quot; hose carrier, only has max 62&quot; space for different carrier. Replaced two missing screws from carrier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and stopped work. The effect of this is that the most important part of my problem, needing a new sewer hose, was not remedied, and the least important, this too-short hose carrier being loose, was all that was worked on.</p>
<h2>What went wrong?</h2>
<p>I can think of a handful of different things that someone could have done to improve the situation. But the most charitable interpretation is that my goal</p>
<blockquote>
<p>new sewer outlet hose and a carrier to match, or just a new sewer outlet hose</p>
</blockquote>
<p>didn't make it to the technician. I probably have a hand in that miss, as does the service writer.</p>
<p>There also might be a little bit of <em><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/2012-09-07/ty-article/word-of-the-day-rosh-gadol/0000017f-e66d-dc7e-adff-f6ed883b0000">rosh gadol</a></em> at work here; come to find out also that I'm not stuck with my too-short 47 inch carrier or a too-long 64 inch carrier – there are adjustable hose carriers. And surely a technician can select a carrier, adjust it to a suitable length, test a new hose to see if it will fit, and finding a match install both and sell them to me.</p>
<p>(It also probably did not help that my expression of the goal included an &quot;or.&quot;)</p>
<h2>The remedy</h2>
<p>Today I told the service writer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My goal is to have a new sewer hose, and the means to carry it, installed on the trailer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exact manner of meeting that goal is open to interpretation, but if that goal makes it to the technician this time I'm confident I will have the result I seek.</p>

            <guid>/_posts/2022/10/30/tightening-up-my-hiring-process-for-ux-practitioners/</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat Oct 29 2022 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I used to have a hiring process that carefully ensured every team member had a role in questioning, evaluating, and discussing each candidate. My employees loved it, but candidates suffered through it and it made us very slow to make decisions. I worked on tightening up the process (and especially its planning and logistics) so we could get through all of the various meetings in a half-day or so. That helped a little bit. Then I tackled improving how we made the yea/nay decision on a candidate, aiming to make a decision the evening of the interview day. We picked up the pace a bit more, but still chewed through a lot of candidates looking for one that would get a thumbs-up from enough people. We were still slow, rejecting too many fine folks that could have helped us. And we wasted a lot of employee time doing so, within each individual candidate's process as well as across candidates.</p>
<p>There were some nice points to this process, namely that we</p>
<ul>
<li>became a lot clearer on the criteria we used to score candidate portfolios</li>
<li>carefully divided interview responsibilities to reduce duplication of questions and topics</li>
<li>became a lot clearer on the few criteria we used</li>
<li>developed a standard scoring scale for each criterion: no/near/yes/plus, where we were hoping for &quot;yes&quot;es but a person who we liked who had a few &quot;near&quot;s might be offered an opportunity to move them to &quot;yes&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I changed jobs to a firm that was much smaller and could not afford a lengthy process, even if that process was contained within a day or two. Even if that process in its rigor strove to protect the firm from mis-hires. We could not involve the whole team. We could not take hours out of everyone's schedule to accomplish an interview, much less a hire. And we had to be even more crisp with how we evaluated people to set aside the inappropriate candidates quickly but not deny a good person an opportunity to shine.</p>
<p>I also realized, when putting this new process together, that part of the stress for candidates is in the gaps between activities – not knowing what to expect, not knowing if you are succeeding or failing, not knowing how to prepare. I strive to reduce these stressors in my hiring process.</p>
<p>I'm also conscious of the work that a candidate is tempted to do to prepare for an interview – polishing their portfolio, doing design exercises, practicing presenting their work. These are all barriers to folks that might be amazing employees but due to other constraints (such as caring for a child or an aging parent, economic pressures, attending school) don't have the time outside of work to polish a portfolio. I don't care about the ability to spend time outside of work preparing, I care about how a person thinks about the work and how that thought appears in the activities they choose and work they produce. I don't need a person to do a bunch of unpaid homework to prove these things to me. I <em>do</em> need them to be able to talk coherently and in some detail about the work they did, how they integrated with the team, what they chose to do and why, how their contributions helped.</p>
<p>The result:</p>
<ol>
<li>I evaluate a candidate's resume and portfolio. I have a little checklist of characteristics/experience/capabilities to watch for. If a person checks most of the boxes I invite them to a screening call. Boxes that aren't checked are noted for steps two and three. (So far I've had success evaluating the &quot;portfolios&quot; of designers, writers, researchers, really anyone that can provide work samples of some kind.)</li>
<li>I have a well-planned half-hour screening call, kept <em>strictly</em> to the half-hour, including a brief explanation of the entire process and what to expect timing- and communication-wise. This explanation demonstrates empathy and helps put the candidate at ease. I explain the job, the company, the team, some of our current challenges, then ask the candidate about what of their experience they find relevant. This gives them an opportunity to learn about the role, decide if it seems exciting or uninteresting, and shape their story. At the end of the call I let the person know if I'd like to talk to them further. In most cases we can schedule our next meeting right then. If not, I explain when they can hear from me.</li>
<li>We have a 90 minute interview mostly organized around portfolio review. I bring one team member to this meeting. Rather than try to go over everything in a candidate's portfolio we ask them just to bring two projects that they are especially proud of that seem relevant in some way to what we discussed in the screening call. I counsel them not to make anything new or fancy for this meeting. They don't need a polished portfolio, they just need real examples of work they've done, in whatever stage of completeness they have. As mentioned above I'm looking for evidence that they actually did the work and their thought processes around the work. This meeting ends with us telling the candidate exactly when they can expect to hear from us. That moment is never more than a day or two away, allowing for weekends.</li>
<li>The team member and I have a quick huddle where we go over our scoring and decide whether or not we'd like to make an offer, and at what level. I immediately work with whatever people at the firm are necessary to get an offer prepared quickly, if needed, and we rapidly communicate a verbal offer or non-acceptance to the candidate within the promised timeframe.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process lowers barriers for the candidate, saves us and the candidate needless anxiety and extra work, is quick yet rigorous, and of the many people I've screened/interviewed/hired, only one turned out to be a mis-hire so far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got laid off today. That's not a win, surely. But it set off a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>The moment I announced I am #openToWork on LinkedIn there was an inrush of good wishes and referrals and recommendations.</li>
<li>The surviving and departing members of my team spontaneously gathered to provide mutual support. Their comments to each other and to me are really heartening.</li>
<li>I remembered to create an alumni Slack, and some people who left prior to this layoff are showing up. As with the flameout of my previous company, there are good people who formed good relationships and are happy to band together.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, to be honest, it's a bit of a relief.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Two basic activities</h2>
<p>There are two basic activities in UX.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You might call these &quot;understand&quot; and &quot;design,&quot; or &quot;investigate&quot; and &quot;generate,&quot; or whatever. It's the same. There's nothing fancy or proprietary about any of this. But you have to do both. If you learn and don't make you are more knowledgeable but don't have a solution to the problem. If you make and don't learn you have a thing, but an indefensible one, with no way of knowing if it is any good.</p>
<p>You might learn to make making easier, or you might have to make some things in order to facilitate learning. You might alternate between learning and making. You might learn, make, make, learn, make, etc. But you'll do both. Sometimes making just captures what you've learned in a form you can use later.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is basic stuff. Baby steps. Even so, some teams fail at this level.</p>
<h2>Three &quot;horizons&quot;</h2>
<p>I like to think of product delivery, and thus the work of research and design, in three segments or horizons.</p>
<p><strong>Horizon one</strong> is the horizon closest to whatever we are hoping to ship soon. I call this the &quot;<strong>detail</strong>&quot; horizon. It involves creating workflows, selecting and laying out controls, defining behavior, formative usability testing, implementation support, and instrumentation. Most teams seem to do most of their work in horizon one. That's an anti-pattern; without adequate attention to the other horizons, work in horizon one is poorly-supported, organizations aren't learning, the designs are accidentally good at best and indefensible at worst.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/11/09/philosophy-of-ux-research-and-design-horizon-three-benefit/">Horizon three</a></strong> is the farthest out. In the third horizon we're looking for problems we might solve for our existing or prospective customers, and proposing benefits that will address those problems. Call it the &quot;<strong>benefit</strong>&quot; horizon. Most teams leave this horizon to product managers and executives, though they shouldn't. Executives especially can fall into the trap of leaping from horizon three to horizon one, or even shortchanging horizon three in an effort to get to horizon one quickly. Horizon three is learn-heavy, but there's making in proposing benefits that the team may choose to deliver.</p>
<p>Between horizons one and three is <strong>horizon two</strong>. This is where we bridge the gap between a benefit and a specific design. I call this the &quot;<strong>concept</strong>&quot; horizon because there are many ways to deliver a given benefit, and we need to figure out some concepts and choose among them before getting into the details. I've witnessed very few teams that explicitly work in this horizon, and the quality of their delivery suffers.</p>
<p><img src="images/Three-horizons.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>I'm still chewing on this</h2>
<p>One quibble I have with this &quot;horizons&quot; idea is that they aren't numbered sequentially; for a given product you work in horizon three, then horizon two, then horizon one. But naming them works and provides a handy mnemonic for the overall workflow: &quot;<strong>benefit</strong>, <strong>concept</strong>, <strong>detail</strong>.&quot; That might be more powerful than speaking in horizons.</p>
<h2>Surely there's more</h2>
<p>Yep. These are just the bones. Flesh yet to be written about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Specific learn and make activities in horizons one, two, and <a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/11/09/philosophy-of-ux-research-and-design-horizon-three-benefit/">three</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How product, UX, and engineering should interact in each horizon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double diamond, <a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/11/09/single-diamond-the-basic-form-of-the-creative-process/">single diamond</a>, how many diamonds and how large</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scaling the process up or down to be responsible the task at hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other philosophical points important to this process</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>I'm using a process initiative at work to demonstrate to the company, especially to folks not on the product team, a basic UX research and design process. The main idea is to short-circuit the all-too-common impulse to leap from an identified problem or need to one seemingly obvious solution. Executives are famous for this, but it's common in other parts of the company as well. Executives are also famous for mixing generation and evaluation, which should be held apart for a while.</li>
<li>Going hard at the gym has started (at long last) to result in <em>less</em> or even <em>no</em> knee pain at night, leading to better sleep. Hallelujah.</li>
<li>I'm getting closer to a unified field theory of UX research and design. Watch this space for stabs at explaining parts of it at various levels. The first bullet above holds one fragment.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been a lot of scuttlebutt about people secretly holding two jobs of late. This is partially due to a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3670596/tech-job-market-is-up-this-year.html">labor market that remains tight, especially in tech</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/business/jobs-hiring-fraud.html">publicity around fraudulent interviewees</a>, and employees having more control over their time in remote and hybrid work environments, among other concerns. This has led to some <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6986537924460785664-PxHd/">needlessly inflated rhetoric</a> and managers comparing notes about how to <a href="https://www.askamanager.org/2021/09/is-there-a-way-to-find-out-if-someone-secretly-has-two-full-time-jobs.html">detect people who are working more than one job</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not that worried about it. The number of jobs an employee has is not my concern.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the person is getting their work done and meeting my performance/communication/availability standards, I don't have a problem.</li>
<li>If they are not getting their work done and/or not meeting my performance/communication/availability standards, I do have a problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>In neither case do I need to cast about for proof that the person is working another job or two, or distracted by caring for an elder parent, or going through a messy breakup, or what have you. I gain nothing by investigating each employee to see if they might be working another job. If I determine that there's a performance problem, I need to talk to the employee and manage the issue.</p>
<p>No one seems to care if an employee in the C-suite serves on multiple boards (unless they are competitors) or advises multiple startups (unless they are competitors). No one seems to care if an employee also plays in a band. No one seems to care if a person sells their ceramics or tunes pianos or works on software projects on the side for free; perhaps it's conflict of interest we're worried about?</p>
<p>If there's no performance problem and no conflict of interest, is there a problem?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's a quick one that has saved me time and helped me mask my frustration:</p>
<p>When dealing with a support agent via online chat, keep a copy of everything you type in a separate text file. That way when you think of a better way to explain yourself, or inevitably have to re-explain everything to another agent, you have text at the ready. It's much less work to copy and paste the relevant bits than to write them all again, is less emotionally taxing, and you can look like the nice person you really are, even if this all has gone on far too long.</p>

<p>In early October I was asked to give an <a href="https://misc.jonplummer.com/portfolio/Quick%20UX%20accomplishments%202022%2010%2005.pptx">eight-to-ten-minute presentation</a> summing up the year for UX. A tall order, but I embraced blazing through the content to alight briefly on things I though the general company audience should know about UX and how we were trying to help.</p>
<p>With most of our work going toward rewrites that have not yet launched there’s little to say about outcomes, so I followed a rapid tour of our outputs with a couple of quick demos and an invitation to view my upcoming Cayuse Connect Conference talk about <a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/11/02/conference-talk-ux-philosophy/">UX philosophy and practice</a>.</p>

<li>The gym was closed on Tuesday. No matter – I went for a run. And it was somewhat enjoyable.</li>
<li>A former coworker sent me a very nice message. It made my week!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope you’re doing well! It’s been quite a while since I last spoke to you, and I wanted to say how much I appreciate the impact you have had on my life. I reap the benefits of it almost daily, and I hope to be like you when I grow up.</p>

<li>In an attempt to be a little more social I had coffee with local friend Joey. It was very nice.</li>
<li>I'm out of the woods far enough on my coming presentations that my stress level has gone down. Now to practice, polish, and cut.</li>
<li>My adjustments to &quot;find maintenance&quot; with my food intake have, with the help of nutrition coach Christine Imperato, seemingly been successful: I'm now hovering easily at around 200 pounds and know how to stay there at my current activity level. It's a good place from which to try a cut later, as an experiment. It's a good place from which to try lots of things.</li>

            <title>"Super" service blueprint</title>

            <pubDate>Fri Sep 30 2022 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="images/Screenshot2022-11-11at2.56.37PM-1024x497.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A service blueprint is typically a design deliverable, showing a user’s journey, the touch points they interact with in whatever channels (web site, application, retail store, call center, etc.), and the behind-the-scenes activities that need coordinating to make that journey a smooth one.</p>
<p>A service blueprint can also be a research deliverable, describing the existing journey and where that coordination breaks down, what the touch points are and whether they are succeeding or failing, etc. usually you’d just do a user journey for this, but sometimes the additional investigation in to the channels and coordination is helpful.</p>
<p>But what if you have not just one user but multiple players interacting with one another? What if you need to understand how all of these players interact so you can decide who to serve, for whom what you already have would be useful, and where the holes in your product are?</p>
<p>Enter the “super service blueprint”. It’s not really a service blueprint as the focus is on the various interacting players you are investigating. But understanding their collective processes and interactions will give you a clear look at the process you’d like your product to be a part of. A clear map of these allows you to locate little chunks of user value that your product already provides and identify opportunities in the collective process to intervene on behalf of one or more users.</p>
<p>You can also see which of the players you are serving the most and the least, just by looking at which users have the build of the interface capabilities and which users have more of their goals and informational needs met across the timeline.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://misc.jonplummer.com/portfolio/AP%20Final-Reduced.pdf">super service blueprint</a> pictured here is the product of an investigation my team did into the Cayuse Vivarium operations products and the handful of different user types who either use them , might use them, or were part of the processes that we intended to help along via our products. This super service blueprint led to a re-thinking of the product strategy, since the investigation revealed that there’s a key user involved in nearly every phase of the overall process, and we could serve that person especially well by reorganizing and improving several software capabilities we already had somewhat in hand.</p>
<p>This super service blueprint involved nine group interviews with different large-institution vivarium operations teams throughout the United States, the production of seven intermediate service blueprints, and a lot of cleanup to make sure it was as communicative as possible. It remains a critical resource to the product management team today.</p>

<li>I've graduated to weighted pushups, &quot;wearing&quot; a 45lb plate.</li>
<li>While a weights workout still leaves me with a sore knee, these bouts are less painful and last less time than in the past. I'm taking it as a sign that I'm pushing hard at workouts and am happy to give myself a little pat on the back for this.</li>

<li>I wisely skipped a workout in favor of a friend's birthday party, and it was good to see here and some old friends from a prior job. We fell right in as if we'd never been out. It was nice.

<p>If we ask a user a question of detail such as one of these we will receive an answer, and we would likely be able to fulfill that answer through design, but we would not have learned why; the resulting design would be indefensible, hearsay. It's akin to asking for and expecting a &quot;sandwich order;&quot; you receive a request you can meet but with no insight by which you could critique or improve upon the request. (This is a problem not just for designers but also for product managers.)</p>
<p>Rather, we should ask questions that help us understand better how the data will be used – where attention needs to be brought, what decisions need to be made, what activities encouraged – so we can come up with and offer a sensible arrangement of data, possibly so we can transform that data into information.</p>

In this case, product managers and engineers embattled by an overwhelming pile of customer commitments had been in hurry-up mode so long that they felt the only way to survive was to be heads-down and ask as few questions as possible. Just accept a brief and punch out a feature, quick and broken. It’s no way to live.</p>

<ol>
<li>I disappeared for two weeks and my team at work continued to ably make progress without my help. Nothing caught on fire, no one got stuck, no one complained. It was heartening to read the scroll back in the team Slack channel and see them tackling issues, supporting each other, making good decisions. :feelsgoodman:</li>
<li>The Huskies look like a much better team than last year, as well they ought. Not a personal win, but this also feels good.</li>
<li>I started learning Norwegian via Duolingo. I feel a little like I'm succeeding through deduction rather than actually learning the language, but it's early yet.</li>
<li>I had a great meeting with a new Product Manager, and see real opportunity to help lead her product family into an interesting and more-obvious-for-users future.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Or, <em>a <strong>corporation</strong> becomes <strong>people</strong> in six acts:</em></p>
<p>Fed up with Job A and planning to move away, I looked for work in the new locale. And I found something. Something a little disappointing in terms of scale and compensation, but it was in the right place, nice people, showed some potential, and in a smaller market with much less of a tech scene what could I expect in compensation, really? Okay, let's do this.</p>
<p><strong>My relationship to Job B</strong>: I am a slightly skeptical new employee – hopeful but a bit disappointed, ready to put a brave face on things and help wherever I can.</p>
<p>Job B wasn't a great business. It was able to pay the bills and pay the people, but incoming employees were typically disappointed by the compensation offered. Longtime employees seemed to stop getting raises at some point. And overall the folks in charge were not much interested, it seemed, in improving the business: making more money, growing, returning more value to the employees. That or they were trying but stuck. Or something; it wasn't happening and there wasn't much talk of being interested in major change.</p>
<p><strong>My relationship to Job B</strong>: I am a guerrilla improver of the business – looking for ways to push us into making a little more money, or delivering a little higher quality, or do a little better at developing people, hopeful but a bit disappointed, ready to put a brave face on things and help wherever I can.</p>
<p>Our arm of the business was an hourly business – we made money selling our time to others. And this, I thought (and still think) is somewhat backwards; in the short term, when one is engaged with a client, your incentives are to sell them as many hours as you can. Your incentives are misaligned with the client's incentives. Getting better at your job so that you deliver quality more quickly actually depresses your earnings. And if margins are tight there's scant room to work ON the business, to make it work better and maybe be able to raise your rates or attract better clients or move into higher-margin work or develop a product or something, as you are too busy working FOR the business. The incentive to improve is out there in the hazy future, requiring a leap of faith while faith is in short supply.</p>
<p>So while I fairly happily worked there for a year and a half or so, it became clear that Job B probably wasn't going anywhere, and that my ideas about how to maybe make it go somewhere weren't interesting to the people in charge, and the part of the business I was in (consulting) was going to continually wrestle for oxygen with the other arm of the business (product), which was also not seeming to go anywhere. It was time to look for Job C.</p>
<p><strong>My relationship to Job B</strong>: I am steady Eddie but looking for the exit – no longer pressing wherever I could press, much more focused on supporting my people and making things as clean as possible so when the right thing came along nothing was destroyed. Still disappointed, but more philosophical about it.</p>
<p>And then Job C comes along. Not without its challenges, but exciting in the way a new job can be even when the challenges are apparent. Maybe I can make a dent in these! Job B folks are sad to see me go, but I'm mentally done with Job B, so, bye.</p>
<p><strong>My relationship to Job B</strong>: I am a distant well-wisher, but without much faith that anything will change. I'm much more concerned about the welfare of individuals I respect and keep in some touch with, and not at all concerned about the fate of the business as a whole, the leadership, folks in the other division, or anyone I found annoying while I was there. I have my own troubles to chew on in Job C.</p>
<p>As I integrated into Job C I started to notice things I had learned at Job B that were useful: more about design systems, more about scrum-like alternatives to project management, much more about accessibility and about bending typical design processes to meet the needs of the moment. Much more tolerance for misguided people, odd opinions, difficulties with priorities and resources, and the strange sort of decisions that leadership sometimes backs into that don't seem sensible lower down on the org chart. So amend the above:</p>
<p><strong>My relationship to Job B</strong>: I am a distant well-wisher, but without much faith that anything will change. I'm much more concerned about the welfare of individuals I respect and keep in some touch with, and not at all concerned about the fate of the business as a whole, the leadership, folks in the other division, or anyone I found annoying while I was there. I have my own troubles to chew on in Job C. But I'm grateful to Job B for many of the things I got to experience while I was there, and draw useful lessons from these. I recognize that <strong>Job B made me better at Job C that I would have been</strong>.</p>
<p>Then comes the news, a surprise to the majority of employees, that Job B is being acquired. This means upheaval and uncertainty, and many of the folks taken by surprise are angry. Angry about disruption, the impeding scattering of Job B social groups, of promises broken, of the small lies that are necessary when an acquisition is in the works, of having to find a new path forward when some can little afford it. This leads me to post here <a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/04/17/empathy-for-the-leader-whose-company-is-being-acquired/">empathy for the leader whose company is being acquired</a>, though since that probably wouldn't play well with most soon-to-be-former Job B folks they see (via LinkedIn) the more-pleasant-and-relevant-to-them <a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/02/06/empathy-for-the-employee-that-arrives-via-acquisition/">empathy for the employee that arrives via acquisition</a>. (I don't chase LinkedIn engagement and rarely post there.)</p>
<p>An alumni Job B Slack team pops up. Lots of Job B folks are active. They are angry at Job B leadership, angry at the acquirer, angry at fate. And it becomes apparent that the acquirer doesn't really know what to do with most of them, or how to treat them well as disrupted potentially-incoming employees. Suddenly Job B is no longer a company for me to be disappointed in but a cadre of wronged, searching, frightened people who are banding together to support each other. And support each other they do, admirably, referring each other to new positions and organizing social events and commiserating and cheering each other's successes. And(!) graciously congratulating those who manage to land positions at the acquiring company, even as others are driven away from it by lowball offers, poor managerial behavior, or other problems.</p>
<p><strong>My relationship to Job B</strong>: I am part of the Job B mutual aid society, a helper, a friendly ear, and, now that the company behind Job B is no more, a potential employer to a few Job B folks (since we are no longer bound by an employee contract that prevents hiring folks away from Job B). I can help! I do help. I'm a bit of a lurker on Slack but I chip in with information and good wishes where I can, and job referrals to a few people. One interviews, gets an offer, and chooses a job elsewhere. One is on my team now and I've overjoyed by that. And now that Job B is not a business its leadership and their choices are moot, so my feelings about my time there are unexpectedly much warmer than before. Job B is now just the people, nothing more. And I love many of those people.</p>
<p>Long live Job B and the kind, smart, and gracious people I met while there. It served me well, in hindsight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three wins:</p>
<ul>
<li>While a respected and very productive design contractor gave notice, she had a lot of nice things to say about the team, company, and my management of the team. I'm sorry to see her go, but I feel pretty good about what I've been doing.</li>
<li>I had a great workout on Tuesday, but that night thought maybe I had injured myself. I had pushed hard, and while I felt good right after the workout about ninety minutes later I had knee pain, enough to have difficulty sleeping. But whatever it was dissipated very quickly, and by Thursday I was ready and able to have another great workout. I'm cautious, but expecting that this weekend things will be even better. A happy side effect is that I regained a little bit more knee flexion range than I expected.</li>
<li>I managed to work some bonus content into my presentation about NPS results, relating complaints in NPS comments to a similar signal in support tickets. I also completed that presentation a little sooner than I had planned. I haven't presented yet, but I'm optimistic. I feel good about what I'm about to do.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five(!) wins for this week. It pays to think about what good is happening:</p>
<ol>
<li>After buying some cheap running shoes ($70, about as cheap as they had that felt good) I went for a run again. I hated it, but only a little bit, mainly at first, and much less that I would have had I not been wearing proper shoes. I'm four runs in and can see this as a possible &quot;thing I do.&quot; Between lifting three times a week, walking sevenish times a week, and running threeish times a week I'm getting a fair amount of exercise now.</li>
<li>My knee flexion has improved to the point that I can do a Turkish get-up on either side without cheating. That's a nice improvement.</li>
<li>One of my mentees has progressed from &quot;how do I convince my boss to let me do what I want&quot; to &quot;how do I communicate about this issue so we can have a productive discussion,&quot; which is a critical change. I'm proud of them!</li>
<li>Upheaval in a product has given that product manager and one of the designers I support to do some real live user research, and they are so excited by what they are learning that it seems like to significantly help the product and strengthen informed collaboration on the team. I'm proud of them!</li>
<li>There was disconcert in a different product team, and I've helped address it mostly by pushing the designer and product owner together, and encouraging the two of them to pull the tech lead in to their discussions. I'm not sure how that team became so disconnected, but it hurt, and we're meeting with some success undoing that. Everyone involved has so far been able to set aside whatever ill will had emerged. I'm proud of them!</li>
</ol>
<p>Never mind the distractions, these are nice results.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three wins for this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>It was less tricky than I feared to come up with four reasonable UX-led programs for the <a href="https://cayuse.com/connect2022/">Connect Conference</a> this October. I'm feeling more optimistic about my (and our) responsibilities for this conference than before.</li>
<li>The nutrition coach pointed out that I'm slightly underfeeding myself with occasional peaks to try to make up for it. Even with those peaks on average I'm a little below where I should be calorie-wise and well-below where I should be protein-wise. That explains why weight and energy have both been proceeding downward and workouts have been getting harder rather than easier. I now have targets that will help me make better choices.</li>
<li>I went for my first run in years, and it wasn't terrible. I went slow, paid attention to duration but not distance or pace, and tried to take it easy on my knee. I used the <a href="https://www.nike.com/nrc-app">Nike Run Club app</a>, since it's free. I'll do this a few more times before making a decision about schedule, shoes, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a little trickier than I expected to find the wins this week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/net-promoter-score/">Net Promoter Score</a> (NPS) is a popular and fashionable customer experience metric meant to express the loyalty of a company's customers. It's simple to administer, and since it's in widespread use a company can compare their results to others fairly easily.</p>
<p>The method is fairly simple: once each year, disconnected from any specific sales or customer service interaction, ask each of your registered users on a scale of zero to ten how likely they are to recommend your brand or product to a friend or colleague. If you're fancy you might also ask why they gave the number that they did.</p>
<p>The method of arriving at a score is also straightforward – subtract the percentage of respondents scoring six or below (detractors) from the percentage of respondents scoring nine or ten (promoters). You now have one number between 100 and –100. If that score is above zero you have more promoters than detractors. A higher NPS score is supposedly correlated with higher sales growth.</p>
<p>What's not to love?</p>
<p>Like other interesting tools such as <a href="https://www.strategicinsights.biz/if-i-had-a-hammer-brainstorming-misunderstood/">brainstorming</a> or <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/it/2022/02/09770437/1D9Gc1bNUNW">Agile</a>, NPS is commonly misunderstood and its practice distorted. People enthusiastic about the idea of NPS press an NPS-like survey into service in all sorts of off-label ways, sowing confusion within their companies. The most common distortions are</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Once each year…&quot;</strong> – It's common to receive an NPS-like question about this or that more often than yearly, increasing the likelihood that the next distortion will take place.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;…disconnected from any specific sales or customer service interaction…&quot;</strong> – It's especially common to receive NPS-like questions during or immediately after customer service interaction, sales interactions, etc. These are not NPS, as they are heavily influenced by the quality of a specific interaction.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;…ask each of your registered users…&quot;</strong> – If your users are not your customers, asking about user loyalty will garner different results than asking about customer loyalty.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;…on a scale of zero to ten…&quot;</strong> – This part of the NPS method is rarely violated.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;…how likely they are to recommend your brand or product to a friend or colleague.&quot;</strong> – This part of the NPS method is less commonly violated, but it does happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any one of these deviations would make your NPS-like survey <em>not</em> NPS. And one of them, confusing <em>users</em> with <em>customers</em> in situations where the two are distinct, is likely to produce misleading results.</p>
<p>It sort of sounds like I'm defending NPS, here, much as I would Agile or brainstorming. But I'm not. The real difficulties with NPS, if you manage to avoid the common traps above, are these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/where-net-promoter-score-goes-wrong">There's scant evidence that respondents' scores on an NPS survey are actually related to their recommendation behavior</a>. This isn't surprising when we consider that the NPS question &quot;how likely are you to…&quot; is asking that person to <em>speculate</em> about their future behavior, which is much less reliable than asking people to <em>report on</em> their past behavior. <a href="https://measuringu.com/article-summaries/measuring-customer-satisfaction-and-loyalty-improving-the-net-promoter-score/">“Satisfaction” and “liking” are better predictors of recommendations</a> than “likelihood to recommend.”</li>
<li><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jmkg.71.3.039">NPS is no better than more direct measures of customer satisfaction</a> at predicting sales growth.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Customer-Satisfaction-customer-experience-customers/dp/0955416116">NPS is not apparently predictive of other behaviors that demonstrate loyalty</a>, such as repeat purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not that you shouldn't use NPS at all. Just be aware of what it is and what it is not. Listen carefully for the real question behind your organization's wish to use NPS, and see if that question can be answered more directly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three wins for this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never mind my thoughts about NPS, which I have not written up here but should (edit: See &quot;<a href="https://jonplummer.com/2022/07/31/the-trouble-with-nps/">The trouble with NPS</a>&quot;). Our company Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is <strong>five</strong>. Five is not terrible as it's above zero, but it's not something to crow about either. That of my team is <strong>eighty</strong>. If you're curious about eNPS, <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/employee-net-promoter-score-enps-good-measure-engagement/">Qualtrics has an okay writeup</a>. Our engagement scores reflect a similar difference, albeit a bit less grand.</li>
<li>Workouts this week, while at the same weights and only slightly higher volume than last week, were unexpectedly much harder. I did 'em anyhow. This might have something to do with the third win; while I've been losing weight slowly, I've also been losing energy slowly.</li>
<li>I started with a <a href="https://www.triplecrownhealth.com">nutrition coach</a>. I'm in the &quot;write everything down and don't change anything&quot; phase, prior to recommendations. I'm not jazzed about taking progress photos, but I <strong>am</strong> excited about having a knowledgeable person help me steer my habits toward my goal of being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kViCSPXyU8U">above average</a>.</li>

<p>Have a good weekend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Past Belkin colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterson-d-ryan/">Ryan Peterson</a> recently began posting his &quot;weekly wins&quot; on LinkedIn. My impression is that he did this in part to steel his resolve during is (successful!) job search, and in part to begin a practice of positive self-talk. As he put it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find it easy to be encouraging and optimistic when talking about others. In the past, however, I have struggled to talk to myself in the same positive way.</p>
<p>Ryan Peterson, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterson-d-ryan_weeklywins-carecollaborationcuriosity-activity-6938577436657750016-jKvJ">Weekly Wins #1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But recognizing my own wins doesn’t come easily. We use 15Five at work, and each week are asked &quot;what went well last week?&quot; This is the hardest part of my 15Five check in to fill in. Ryan points out,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I've been struggling to overcome when identifying wins is to allow myself to accept a small win, such as getting lunch with my mom. Also just the practice of taking time to write them down is &quot;forcing&quot; me to be reflective. I'm optimistic that as I continue on this path it will become easier to identify my own wins, and I'll be able to model this for my family at home, and in the workplace.</p>
<p>Ryan Peterson, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterson-d-ryan_weeklywins-carecollaborationcuriosity-activity-6953939743474679808-yDfO">Weekly Wins #7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accepting a small win may also be a piece of my challenge.</p>
<p>I have already begin thanking others at work as a weekly practice, one I hope comes across as authentic; with this new practice I hope to foster an accurate feeling of regular accomplishment.</p>
<p>So! Three four wins for this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>I witnessed people on my team enthusiastically collaborating and demonstrating gratitude for each other, suggesting that my effort forming a cohesive team is working.</li>
<li>I helped an embattled product time seize the crisis-opportunity created by the diversion of their engineering staff with a solid research plan and a method to capture what they will learn as they prepare for a new take on their product.</li>
<li>I had a lovely meeting with someone in People Operations where I got a sneak peek into our culture survey results, lending credence to insights gained by looking at exit interview data.</li>
<li>I used <a href="https://localwp.com">Local</a> to transform my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6_PXXjU94">slow-as-something-really-slow</a> blog into a speedy static site. I'm not shilling for Local, here; it just seemed like a quick way to make this change.</li>

<p>Same time next week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mathilda asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you all share how you distinguish product designers from user experience designers? I’ve been trying to determine the differentiation with other UX friends, but it still seems a bit foggy. Some have explained it to me as user experience designers focus on users and usability, and product designers focus on “everything”, i.e. the product and the business. Many of the user experience books and resources I read (Lean UX, Build Better Products, UX Strategy, NNgroup) though seem to frequently connect business outcomes with UX. I’ve also heard the difference explained as product designers having greater visual design specialization, but I’ve seen that in UX designer roles as well. Also, why not hire a visual designer in that situation?</p>
<p>Mathilda in <a href="http://wherearethebl-dwx1391.slack.com">Where are The Black Designers?</a> Slack</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It IS foggy, and as usual, I think the term &quot;product designer&quot; was coined to clarify but failed to do so (and introduced conflict with industrial designers among others). I think it mainly comes from poor mutual understanding of the term &quot;UX&quot; and what all a UX designer does or might do in different settings. This varies WIDELY by organization; in general, the larger the org the narrower the role of an individual contributor UX designer and the more the job(s) of working on a specific experience are distributed over multiple people. This narrowing of the role of a UX designer in large organizations has led to folks who do more than &quot;Edward wifreframe-makin'-hands&quot; to adopt the &quot;Product Designer&quot; term.</p>
<p>Here's what I see as a rough breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphic</strong>: the visual design of things, especially print pieces, marketing collateral, informational websites</li>
<li><strong>UI</strong>: the visual and microinteractive design of web applications, mobile applications, and desktop applications</li>
<li><strong>UX</strong>: the interaction design of web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, and <em>occasionally</em> embedded or physical interfaces, with an emphasis on arranging the larger requirements and workflows to meet business goals and user needs together, and the research required to do a good job of this (sometimes some of this UX role is split off into a separate Researcher role)</li>
<li><strong>Product</strong>: UX + UI</li>
</ul>
<p>But companies don't necessarily follow this, and these terms mean different things to different people, and so it's always useful to</p>
<ul>
<li>when looking for a job
<ul>
<li>be open to multiple titles in your job search</li>
<li>look for clues in the job descriptions you are considering</li>
<li>explain your capabilities and aptitudes rather than trying to choose a title – use plain English</li>
<li>ask questions of your prospective employers about what they mean when they say they want a {whatever} designer and compare their answers to what you want to do (always a good idea anyhow)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when hiring
<ul>
<li>be thoughtful and consistent with the language you use in your organization</li>
<li>explain what you're really looking for when you write a job description rather than relying on the title</li>
<li>eliminate needless qualifications and job requirements from the job description</li>
<li>write a job ad that describes daily and regular activities and how these contribute to org success</li>
<li>remember that a job description is not a job ad</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when talking within your org
<ul>
<li>be thoughtful and consistent with the language you use in your organization</li>
<li>coach managers and leaders to be consistent in this same way, which will require explaining why</li>
<li>plan needed capacity and capabilities before settling on roles and titles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>How do I get experience doing a thing without a job doing the thing</em>? By doing the thing anyway.</p>
<p>For design or coding there are two good places to start, and you probably should pursue both:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can adding a bit of design or coding enhance your current job? Are there repetitive tasks that might be automated, information that could be brought together into a dashboard, metrics or research that might inform your work or the work of your team, places where quality might be improved through greater understanding or thoughtfulness? You can offer to do things, or just start to do them. You can learn a lot by applying new skills to something you already know about.</li>
<li>What parts of coding or design can you try with what you already have, on your own time? I got started in design because I found desktop publishing tools fun to play with in college, and used them to make greeting cards, tee shirts, and to enhance my classwork. Playing with the tools in ways that scratched my own itches taught me skills that I could later apply to my work.</li>
</ol>
<p>In re point 2 above, my daughter mentioned to me that she might be interested in filmmaking. I told her, &quot;you have a phone, start making some films!&quot; Getting started can be that easy. Your work might not be won't be very good at first. That's fine. Keep going unless you find you don't like the process. Competence will come later.</p>
<p>Starting in management is a little different, but again I see two straightforward paths and it might be worthwhile to pursue both:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer to help/take ownership of small moments in your job where coordination is needed, process change is needed, or a problem needs to be sorted out. This will give you experience talking to others to learn about a situation, proposing possible approaches, marshaling the effort of others, and delivering a result. This is managing! Managing in small ways leads to success managing in small ways, which leads to larger opportunities. The reward for good work is more work.</li>
<li>Volunteer with charitable or vocational organizations and offer to help in ways that are more like 1 above over time.</li>
</ol>

<p>The key things I expect here are:</p>
<ol>
<li>advance warning if at all possible</li>
<li>file diligently (well before when warning is possible, right after if not)</li>
<li>provide the same level of warning to your team</li>
<li>negotiate well in advance with your team what to do to make sure things bowl along in your absence (you have things ready, what slack will others need to take up, what can wait for your return)</li>
<li>ask for help if needed</li>
<li>negotiate one week in advance with your team what to do to make sure things bowl along in your absence</li>
<li>ask for help if needed</li>
<li>check on how things went once you return and negotiate the new way forward from there (given that conditions may have changed)</li>
<li>ask for help if needed</li>

<li>proceed as if nothing will change, as there's no deal until the deal is complete, and</li>
<li>plan the future in which everything will change, rendering the rod that went into &quot;proceed as if nothing will change&quot; entirely moot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along the way, especially if one of the groups (acquirer or acquired) is a publicly-traded firm, one must hide the coming deal from all but the very few people who are involved in accomplishing it. This is necessary and difficult and thankless.</p>
<p>Difficult because you have information that you cannot share that will have a sudden and material effect on the lives of people you've supported and come to care about. Difficult because the working of the deal puts an awkward gap in whatever plans you have together, and so you must dodge, delay, make excuses. Difficult because if the deal falls through you'll have to pick up the pieces and paper over breakage caused by these gaps. Few will know why or what happened, just that you were unaccountably ineffective for a while.</p>
<p>Thankless because when the deal does happen all of your vagueness during the gap will be revealed as lies, lies that people won't understand, lies that hurt to tell as you told them and hurt again as the people you deceived bark at you for deceiving them. Which you had to do.</p>
<p>Thankless too because any negative consequence of the deal, however indirect, is also on your head. Your reputation among those affected <em>will</em> be harmed. And yet it was probably the right thing to have done, to pursue the acquisition, to draw investment toward the idea that you gathered these people together to work on, or you would not have done it. Sad that the result is pain and resentment and blame.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday last week I deleted a chunk of the wiki. All of the product management pages, in fact. The work of a team of fifteen, organizing and guiding the work of a hundred people, gone. I've managed to avoid being fired, so far. People have been very nice about this, so far. But I don't expect their good will to last: as they trip over the lack of things that were once in place they will learn the painful extent of my big mistake.</p>
<p>There were many failures involved in this big mistake, but the biggest failure belongs to me.</p>
<h2>What happened</h2>
<p>The design team, which I lead, had been putting our recent work on the design system, user research, interaction guidelines, etc. in the product management space for quite a while now, but there was a disused old space that contained similar but outdated content, penned by past designers, that cluttered up search results and created confusion among the design and product teams. I was working through the contents of this area, moving some pages to the product management space and marking them as old work, archiving other pages, and deleting &quot;stubs&quot; (pages devoid of content) outright. So I was working in two spaces at once.</p>
<p>At some point the disused old space was effectively empty, so I thought I'd delete it. From the homepage of the disused space I went to space administration, and chose to delete the space. And since I had just done a lot of work there to clear it out, and thought of that work as now safe in the product management space, I didn't pay super-close attention to the confirmation message that warned that the deletion was not reversible. But that confirmation was attempting to warn me that I was deleting the product management space. I blithely confirmed the deletion, then a progress bar appeared, and grew, and was not cancelable.</p>
<p>As the progress bar grew I realized what I had done and panic rose in my chest. I quickly opened a new window and quickly did an export of the product management space, which was in the process of being deleted. I got 22MB of data, so not nothing, but that export is likely partial; I have no idea how large a full export would have been.</p>
<p>Expecting that I had just caused my imminent firing, I immediately Slacked someone in IT for help, my VP of Product to tell her what I had done, and the product team as a whole to apologize and point out that I would do my best to find a solution. As I said, people have been very nice about this, so far. I hope I can act in such a way that preserves at least some of that good will.</p>
<p>I hope they reduce my rights on the system significantly.</p>
<h2>Lessons for me</h2>
<p>I was working in two spaces at once, so the likelihood of &quot;pedal error,&quot; choosing the wrong action believing it is the right one, was high.</p>
<p>I'll probably never know if it was pedal error or a bug that caused the wrong space to be offered to me for deletion. I believed I had selected the correct space for deletion. But sure of myself in that moment I skimmed over the confirmation step. Others have had this same complaint, if the support site is to be believed, that they selected one space for deletion and were offered a different one. Even so, I should have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read and heeded confirmation messages</strong>. Failing to do this was the core of my big mistake.</li>
<li><strong>Taken a moment before doing anything momentous</strong> or destructive. A bit of time can be room for your brain to catch up to your hands.</li>
<li><strong>Taken my own steps to make destructive acts recoverable</strong>. I could have done a full export of both spaces before deleting anything. Had I bothered to actually read the confirmation message I may have thought to do so. Had I paused I may have thought to do so. It would take only a few minutes and be free insurance against catastrophe.</li>
<li><strong>Made use of archival or &quot;logical delete&quot; rather than destructive processes</strong>. When available, archiving a page or a space or other record is inherently more recoverable than deleting. It's not clear if this was an option in my case, but it's a good idea. If you find you never visit these archived items, you can choose to delete them later.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm happy that I had already learned these lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hang a lantern on your problem</strong>. Had I not started communicating immediately, I'm sure things would be much worse for me. Worse, had I said nothing, I would eventually have been found out and fired not for the mistake but for the cover-up. In my panic it did take a half a beat to recall this lesson.</li>
<li><strong>Form a plan with multiple paths to success</strong>. It's not safe to rely on a single path to disaster recovery. How many paths to success can you think of? Can you pursue all of them? How can you maximize your chance of success? If you have just one plan, and it fails, then what?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons for interfaces and systems</h2>
<p>If you would like your system to be kind to me and other normal folks, you'll want to arrange things so mistakes are harder to make, or easier to recover from, or both. There are a lot of things you can do, roughly in order from least to most difficult:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer recovery preparation activities alongside the destructive action</strong>. It's straightforward to add a reminder to make an export or backup to your confirmation message. Would it have helped me? Who can say.</li>
<li><strong>Offer recovery preparation activities alongside the confirmation message</strong>. It's a little less straightforward to offer an export at the point of confirmation. But it's not that hard, and that reminder will catch some folks before they make a mistake.</li>
<li><strong>Make confirmation of destructive acts require reading to complete</strong>. You've seen this in Figma and other places, where you are asked to type something to confirm the action. The best of these ask you to think a little bit; &quot;Type the name of the space to confirm that you want to delete it&quot; is better than &quot;type DELETE to confirm that you want to delete this space&quot; as it requires a bit more attention. In this case, a little cognitive load is your friend.</li>
<li><strong>Make lengthy or multi-step destructive acts cancelable</strong>. Even if part of the information is saved it is better than watching the system slowly put your mistake into practice with no recourse. In my case, deleting a space involves several transactions – making each page a hidden page, removing the association of the space with its home or overview page, deleting each page, then deleting the now empty space. Stopping at any point in that chain of events would have spared some fraction of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Offer archival or logical delete in addition to outright deletion</strong>. Users are more likely to mishandle their data if alternatives to deletion are not available.</li>
<li><strong>Offer archival or logical delete <em>instead of</em> outright deletion</strong>. Users can't delete if they can't delete This increases data storage costs, and signs you up to write more interfaces to browse and change the status of archived records, but major mistakes become minor ones.</li>
<li><strong>Automatically perform recovery preparation activities</strong>. An automatic export prior to deletion adds time and storage cost to the process, but can save someone's day by giving them the tools needed to undo a mistake.</li>
<li><strong>Make destructive acts easily recoverable</strong>. This is the most expensive yet most <em>polite</em> way to handle user data. Let any act be undoable. It's not easy to architect, much less to implement, but the level of comfort it offers to users is extreme. Mistakes in word processors used to be costly and painful, but today they are trivialities. And the effort it takes away from users is likely worth the design and engineering costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons for organizations</h2>
<p>A prior IT regime read about the backup practices of our vendor and felt that they were sufficient protection. They read that the vendor makes nightly backups and retains them for thirty days. But there they stopped reading, not noticing that these backups are not offered to clients and are only for vendor-level disaster recovery. So while a backup technically exists, it is no protection from client-caused mishaps. There are several lessons in this one fact:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not expect your users not to make mistakes</strong>. See &quot;lessons for me&quot; above to learn of typical mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Read the whole contract</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Do not leave backup solely up to your vendor</strong>, even if their backup plan sounds adequate. if you aren't in control of your data, you aren't in control of your data.</li>
<li><strong>Do not believe you have a working backup unless you've practiced recovering</strong> via that backup. What does it take to recover from a disaster? How do you know? Are you really ready to accomplish this? One way to find out.</li>
<li><strong>Do not believe you have a working backup unless you've verified its contents</strong>. Ah, you have a backup. Your'e covered! Unless…drat, the backup is corrupted, or incomplete, or old because the job has been failing for a while, or a thousand other problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also the small matter of roles and privileges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The less safe the data is, the fewer people should be allowed to harm it</strong>. No backup? Restrict deletion privileges to relatively inaccessible people, not day-to-day editors. Yes, they'll grumble. But it is for their own good.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My plan, and what I've done so far</h2>
<p>I've got a partial export, a backup locked up at the vendor that I allegedly do not have access to, an unknown level of inconvenience caused to coworkers, and an unknown amount of time and effort between now and whatever level of recovery I am able to effect. Above I mentioned having and putting into practice multiple paths to success. The possible paths to success seem to be</p>
<ul>
<li>restoring the export and finding out what is in it, in hopes that it meaningfully reduces the loss</li>
<li>appealing to the vendor to have access to their backup, which should be complete</li>
<li>scouring the existing IT infrastructure for any possible existing export or backup we might have</li>
</ul>
<p>I am pursuing all of these in parallel. In the meantime I have</p>
<ul>
<li>communicated this plan with my supervisor, with my employees, and with my peers and others on the product team</li>
<li>apologized to the design and product teams and individually to select people, especially those who had recently contributed or shared work via the wiki</li>
<li>shared my plan with the current IT regime so that we can help each other</li>
<li>opened a temporary space for the teams to use to avoid namespace pollution or any untoward effects of a possible full, partial, or botched restore</li>
</ul>
<p>I am also communicating the emerging status with team members daily.</p>
<p>I know that with all of this, the likelihood of a full recovery is slim. And I know that at a certain point, some organizations will fire an employee for the effect of their mistakes regardless of the circumstances. If that comes to pass I will understand. But I will pursue multiple paths to success until that happens.</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>The product management area of the wiki is back. My export was not usable, but the vendor agreed to help by rolling the wiki back to the moment prior to deletion, allowing us to export the data for the product management space, rolling it forward again, and allowing us to re-import the exported data. Thanks be to the IT person who convinced the vendor to help and who worked on the problem after-hours so that on the morning of day six we had the data back in place.</p>
<p>A side-effect of this is that every inbound link to pages in this area is broken. But so far this seems surmountable. Another side effect is that we now have a backup strategy that we are in charge of, and will not have to appeal to the vendor for further help if additional mistakes are made. I expect a security/privileges audit will come soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="images/dabrahams_question-1024x826.png" alt="If a task takes six hours to complete in the office, but that same employee finishes out in four working from home, who should get the saved two hours? The company ('back to work!') or the employee ('free time')?"></p>
<p>I don't like either of these options. Of course, the employee in me wants to be rewarded for producing efficiently, and the manager in me wants to take advantage of that efficiency to improve the business overall; this is the simple conflict that the question hinges on. But Daniel's question and its two options miss the mark entirely because they assume that the employee is being paid either for their time, i.e. selling hours, or by the task or piece, i.e. selling some number of completions of a well-defined task.</p>
<p>This is not how I want to arrange my work or the work of the people I support. I am not paying them for their time, and I am not paying them by the piece. And I can't really; as knowledge workers</p>
<ul>
<li>our work is not so well-defined as to be sensibly thought of as piecework, and</li>
<li>our time is not a good unto itself, rather it is the way we apply that time that produces results that are valuable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowledge workers negotiate and accept anticipated results they are to participate in producing, and then act largely as they see fit to do so. They are paid a salary and evaluated based on their contribution to these results. It's hard to do a good job without some amount of continuous improvement, as we are learning as we go, and a valued contributor will find ways to do a little better than last time.</p>
<p>That improvement has a few rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>it produces a sense of accomplishment,</li>
<li>it creates success for the team and organization, and</li>
<li>it makes the job easier over time,</li>
<li>it frees up some effort to work on more interesting things,</li>
<li>it makes space for the employee to make decisions about balancing their ambition and their need for rest.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the ideal case, all five of these rewards are produced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a few ways these meetings might be organized depending on where we are in the design-development process.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>early concept</strong>: help me think about the problem</li>
<li><strong>late concept</strong>: help me choose among these ideas and develop one</li>
<li><strong>early detail</strong>: this is where we are going, what caveats remain?</li>
<li><strong>late detail</strong>: here's a the detail, what questions do I need to address?</li>
</ul>
<p>These depend on the thought that there are a few phases/horizons to product design work, namely</p>
<ol>
<li>Problem Framing (aka Research or Horizon 3), in which we learn about the challenges and needs of users to understand and select a problem to go after with concepts,</li>
<li>Concept (or Horizon 2), in which we develop concepts and select among them with the help of users and engineering, and</li>
<li>Detail (or Horizon 1), in which we develop the selected concept and test the fitness of our more detailed work with users as we go.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a common anti-pattern that engineering gets involved only when we are in detail, but we'd like to pull them into the other phases to be informed about the available problems and to help us develop and select among concepts.</p>
<p>Some Agile purists will decry this phasing as anti-agile, but that requires a blinkered view of what Agile means, which often comes about when one confuses Scrum for Agile. (The dirty little secret of Scrum is that there's a lot of hand-waving about the large quantity of work that needs to happen outside of sprints to make Scrum possible.)</p>

            <title>Do you have some key metrics that you are measuring your team on (number of items added to the pattern library, number of customer interviews, etc)?</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I tend not to be in favor of output metrics like these; they've been shown to be counterproductive for developers (lines of code, commits, bugs crushed, etc.), for example. But I am thinking about how best to apply the process maturity scorecard to the work of the individual designers to try to coach them on their projects. If a designer is helping to improve the process maturity of their product team(s), that's a good sign.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some anti-metrics (trouble indicators) are pretty obvious – if there's a lot of rework coming back to a designer, if deliverables are sloppy, if product managers and engineers are dissatisfied or under-involved, then we can tell there is a problem. But the opposite of these are not great metrics for individual performance, as a certain amount of rework will be technically driven, we don't want to create an inspection-heavy situation where each deliverable is scrutinized for lack of sloppiness, etc.</p>
<p>I do have expectations that designers will bring work to and contribute to critique, seek my counsel on design challenges, press for collaboration, etc. But do I want to count these behaviors? Probably not.<br>
The ideal thing would be to peg team performance to the product metrics we hope to install. The metrics we really care about are user success metrics in a product, and these are team metrics, not individual performance metrics.</p>
<p>So when it comes time to evaluate a designer, I like to use four Cs – customer, collaboration, culture, and content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Customer</strong> – is the work produced by the designer informed by the customer, appropriate to the customer, accepted by the customer?
<ol>
<li><em>Informed</em> a leading indicator, evidenced by their participation in research and testing. They are or are not doing this. Exactly how much is situational, nonnumeric.</li>
<li><em>Appropriate</em> is somewhat evident in testing, and ultimately evident in adoption, a lagging indicator (and highly dependent on product and engineering decisions, the appropriateness of the feature idea in the first place, etc.).</li>
<li><em>Accepted</em> is essentially adoption. The same caveats apply.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – is the designer an effective collaborator on their project teams? Do they work well with their peers and their project teams?</li>
<li><strong>Culture</strong> – what is the designer's contribution to the culture? Are they intellectually and emotionally engaged in a way that improves their teams and the org, is neutral, or detracts from their teams and the org? Are they improving and helping the culture improve?</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong> – is the designer's work organized, communicative, complete, insightful, timely? Are their skills and attention to detail usefully on display in their work?</li>
</ol>
<p>The best articles out there about measuring designer performance are a) not very good and b) old, such as <a href="https://uxcellence.com/2016/measuring-designer-performance">Measuring Designer Performance</a>, or <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-create-KPIs-for-my-design-team">How do I create KPIs for my design team</a>. So I've been content to use those four Cs, which are similar in concept to how <a href="https://ideo.com">IDEO</a> evaluates their creative and engineering staff.</p>

            <title>Confusing terms: globalization, internationalization, translation, and localization</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At work there's been a move afoot to tag items in our roadmapping tool as &quot;globalization,&quot; &quot;internationalization,&quot; &quot;localization,&quot; or &quot;translation.&quot;</p>
<p>The executive level thinking here is that we are not offering our products globally, and need to be. So what do you do about that? You globalize!</p>
<p>To my thinking, though, there are universal requirements, things that the underlying product should do everywhere, and requirements borne of local data formats, terms of art, regulatory environments, etc. Universal versus local. Then there's the work of offering interfaces and commendation in a newly-supported language, and the things you must do technologically to make your application able to deliver these universal and local requirements and serve interfaces and documentation in the correct languages.</p>
<p>To my thinking, a universal requirement is just a requirement. The special ones, therefore interesting to tag, are</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>localization</strong>: things that need to be done differently due to a locale's needs – preferred data formats, regulatory environment, terms of art, etc.</li>
<li><strong>translation</strong>: the actual translation of interfaces and documentation into a newly-supported language or English variant</li>
<li><strong>internationalization</strong>: things that must be done technologically to enable us to address either of the above</li>
</ul>
<p>A tag that would be applied to all or almost all of the items seems like it might not be that useful. Globalization is the goal, not a specific type of work. It probably doesn't make sense to separately call out universal requirements, as these should be numerous. Most work should be universal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, globalization also includes marketing and sales and support and other things. Trying these terms on wrt marketing: we want to globalize our marketing, so we consider the universal messages we want prospective customers to understand (which should not be a special effort), then we look at how these might need to be localized (made locally specific/applicable) and translated (in the right language), and what processes we need to internationalize (tech/process/people to enable the above) to make conveying these messages possible.</p>
<p>I might be thinking about this wrongly, but this is my current understanding.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heather asked me yesterday &quot;who owns accessibility?&quot; That's a fun question. I replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accessibility is not owned. Who owns quality? It's a team responsibility. To the extent that accessibility compliance, or release date, or the P&amp;L is a &quot;feature&quot; of a piece of software it is owned by the PM, but each function has its responsibilities in accomplishing accessibility. Making these responsibilities explicit is necessary.</p>
<p>The folks with responsibilities mainly include UX (designing for accessibility), FED (engineering for accessibility), QA (inspection), and PM/PO (prioritization). These aren't collected in one person's purview around here until the CEO, so that's not the answer to your question.</p>
<p>If we are to be product-led and not sales-led, PM has to insist on it (and manage competing priorities), maybe that's part of the answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;ownership&quot; urge seems to sometimes dilute or deprioritize the responsibilities of others, which is a shame because we must work in concert.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My impression is:</p>
<ol>
<li>When we pressure people to overproduce we encourage them to defend themselves in ways that seem locally sensible but turn out to be anti-collaborative.</li>
<li>Financial planning, especially when the business is not self-funded, tends to require a forecast; that forecast hangs from a roadmap, effort estimates, and sales targets.</li>
<li>When a business sees the sales team as its economic engine rather than the product itself (sales teams tend to be good at preserving this impression), opportunities detected by sales get pushed onto that roadmap with less discussion than necessary.</li>

<p>Maybe I don't. What if I instead explain what I am there to do? What would that be like?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am building a design and research team to support the collection of 25+ disparate built and acquired products into a single coherent suite. Since I've recently begun, here's what I plan to accomplish:<br>
• Develop UX and UI design capacity and capability<br>
• Add and develop UX research capability<br>
• Install formative usability testing during design to de-risk detailed design decisions<br>
• Install user insights research, concept design and validation<br>
• Stand up a team and processes to build and improve a design system in visuals and code, for the product suite<br>
• Gather and improve product personas to be an informative smaller set of personas for the entire suite<br>
• Begin instrumentation of new features, to measure outcomes, by determining desired outcomes at the epic level<br>
• Help the product team take advantage of existing pre-customer and post-launch data, such as customer success contact data, support forum and knowledge base behavior, RFP mining, sales demo feedback, etc.</p>

<p>I suppose over time I could exchange some of these for my accomplishments and my new plan. I've not seen this anywhere else. Good idea? Bad idea?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/37821/">Design Thinking group on LinkedIn</a>, Sara Bermúdez <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6841731698523291648/">asked</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would love to hear your opinions on which are the most important mindsets for the future of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:groupPost:37821-6841721798678212608?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28groupPost%3A37821-6841721798678212608%2C6841756174824669184%29">I had a take</a> on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find I often have to nudge people out of what I've come to call constraint-based thinking. Focusing on and reacting to the apparent constraints in a situation can lead to a poor solution and a feeling of being stuck with that poor solution, a double-whammy of negativity. &quot;We couldn't do X because of A, we couldn't do Y because of B, so we're stuck with Z, like it or not.&quot; Chances are good that there's a way to meet the goal that manages or makes irrelevant these constraints that you'll be happier with than where you are seemingly stuck, but it requires exploring ways to meet the goal rather than rattling around in a box of obstacles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steven Forth responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there skills we can cultivate that helps us escape from the self-imposed constraints of constraint based thinking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I elaborated a bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure. Some are implied above.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify and articulate a <em>goal</em> as a <em>benefit</em> (where a benefit is the happy result NOT expressed in terms of exactly how it is delivered).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider a person's needs and a business's needs together rather than separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When confronted with a problem or pain point, learn about and offer possible benefits (some folks call them &quot;gain points&quot;) rather than solutions, at first. Later you can design or select a way to deliver that benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think in scenarios: <em>who</em> arrives in <em>what</em> situation, <em>when</em> and <em>where</em>, with <em>which</em> need or goal to address or accomplish, and <em>what</em> can the system (or organization, etc.) offer them?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that most of these thoughts require a <em>positive wording</em> of the situation or aim rather than a <em>negative wording</em>. This might be the key skill, broadly useful but not sufficient on its own. You'll see this in health fields when practitioners take a wellness perspective—rather than cease some harmful behavior like smoking, they'll talk about replacing the habits associated with smoking with healthier rituals, moving nicotine delivery to a less-harmful medium where it can be managed, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many other good comments there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gentle people,<br>
I recently complained to the directors and project managers about meeting invitations</p>
<ul>
<li>without agendas, or</li>
<li>without a clear goal, or</li>
<li>without a sense of what a person might be expected to do in a meeting, or</li>
<li>without a sense of what person might need to do to prepare for a meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that, generally, the project managers aren't to blame here. The VPs and directors are to blame more than we should be, but especially the populace—most folks are not that great about helping the folks they invite to a meeting be ready for that meeting.</p>
<p>This is a thing that design folks can be especially good at. We're accustomed to thinking about others and their needs. All we need to do is remember to think about these at the moment we are scheduling the meeting.</p>
<p>The people who are coming to your meeting need to know what the meeting is meant to accomplish and how they are going to be useful. Please tell them by including that information in the invitation.</p>
<p>If we get good at this, others will notice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Concentric Sky we delivered some form of design system or pattern library to every client depending on their needs and the maturity of the digital property we were working on. For Western Governors University we were working on a new internal tool to manage rich skill descriptors (RSDs), but worked on a complete pattern library up front to speed our own development of the first version of the tool and enable rapid improvements in subsequent projects.</p>
<p>Central to this effort was the <a href="https://misc.jonplummer.com/portfolio/WGU%20acceptance%20criteria%20for%20patterns.pdf">Acceptance Criteria for Patterns</a> document pictured here. The document included a block diagram of a typical page, followed by descriptions of the form and expected behavior of each pattern, and which smaller patterns each larger pattern incorporates. Each pattern also links the corresponding part of the design system.</p>
<p><img src="images/Screenshot2022-11-11at3.30.55PM-960x1024.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The document serves as a reference to front- and back-end developers and QA, and greatly sped the production of shared code and the subsequent testing of the views and workflows produced. It’s estimated that front-end views for the first version of the tool took less than half the time to develop and test one the patterns were in place, and QA commentary was able to focus on larger behavioral questions rather than detailed control behavior and layout.</p>
<p><img src="images/Screenshot2022-11-11at3.31.21PM-1024x1000.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I was the primary author of this document, though several people helped, and the feedback from engineering and QA was invaluable in improving it.</p>

            <title>A lightweight, improvement-oriented roadmapping process</title>

            <pubDate>Sat May 22 2021 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of great articles about developing a roadmap for a product or service. But sometimes these processes can seem too heavy, too slow, or too strategic (is there such a thing?) for the task at hand. A lightweight process, aimed at selecting and ordering improvements rather than expressing an ideal and working toward it, can work when certain conditions are met.</p>
<h2>Conditions</h2>
<ol>
<li>The product (or process or service) exists already.</li>
<li>Stakeholders are certain the product does essentially what it is supposed to do, but are dissatisfied by the results.</li>
<li>There are too many potential problems and potential fixes to clean them all up in a single project, though this is desired, or</li>
<li>the political situation is such among stakeholders that choosing a good place to start will be difficult (some may not want their area touched, others may want to go first, still others may not want to work.</li>
</ol>
<p>These conditions assume that the strategy is good, and that the stakeholders' attempts to fulfill that strategy are based on sound choices, but are perhaps not well-executed.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>To successfully produce a roadmap and manage the political situation among the stakeholders we must accomplish a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uncover and arrange opportunities for improving the product.</li>
<li>Group and sequence the opportunities.</li>
<li>Plan the work for the first step on the roadmap.</li>
</ol>
<p>Along the way we must be careful to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make good use of any work the stakeholders have done to date.</li>
<li>Demonstrate to stakeholders that we understand the current situation.</li>
<li>involve the stakeholders in determining the value and feasibility of addressing each opportunity.</li>
<li>Involve the stakeholders in negotiating the roadmap and selecting the first step.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stakeholders appear in each of the four points above. We must bring them though this process and ensure that they are heard, and are at times active participants, but we must not become wrapped up in their shenanigans. There are defined points in the process where we involve them.</p>
<h2>The process</h2>
<p><img src="images/Roadmap-generation-process-Copy-of-Roadmap-generation-process-2-1024x805.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>1. Investigation</h3>
<p>The first few steps of the investigation phase will occur together, and as you learn more you may find yourself returning to stakeholders for clarification, more information, or scope adjustment. The investigation phase typically takes the longest of the three.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stakeholder research to establish goals and wishes, and collect their ideas.</li>
<li>Primary user and stakeholder research to understand existing needs and processes and learn of opportunities</li>
<li>Review secondary research (research done by others).</li>
<li>Express any found problems/opportunities (often pain points) in terms of their benefits (&quot;gain points&quot;) and likely features.</li>
<li>Arrange these opportunities by theme to see if and where problems are concentrated.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step four is critical: you'll have detected many problems and pain points, but need to express them first in terms of a benefit you'd like to deliver rather that just a feature. Remember that a <em>benefit</em> is the result of having a problem solved expressed <em>without regard to the exact method of solving it</em>. If you learn that students struggle to fill out a financial aid form on time, it would be tempting to offer an advisor to help them. That's a feature, and it might not be the right one; the benefit may be that students have the information they need to fill out the form quickly and submit it easily. Go ahead and offer features, but only after identifying the benefits. The stakeholders will help us choose features once the benefits are clear.</p>
<p>We arrange opportunities by theme now to see if it tempts the stakeholders to narrow the scope of the project. You have to start somewhere, and the earlier we can reduce scope the higher the likelihood that the project will produce a useful first increment.</p>
<p>At this point you'll have be ready to show the stakeholders your understanding of the current situation and the opportunities you've uncovered. This will fulfill both &quot;make good use of any work the stakeholders have done to date&quot; and &quot;demonstrate to stakeholders that we understand the current situation&quot; reminders above.</p>
<h3>2. Synthesis</h3>
<p>You've produced the raw material necessary for the stakeholders to help arrange opportunities into a rough sequence. Depending on scope the entire synthesis phase could be done in one workshop, or it might require two with some thinking and preparation in between.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a workshop with stakeholders to score opportunities by value and feasibility.</li>
<li>Examine the high-value, high-feasibility opportunities for common themes, then sequence all opportunities within these themes according to value and feasibility. More doable and higher-value items come first, and valuable low-feasibility items come last.</li>
<li>Have a workshop with stakeholders to arrange these themes in sequence according to feasibility and value.</li>
</ol>
<p>Scoring opportunities for value and feasibility is a simple matter of placing these on everyone's favorite business diagram, the 2x2 matrix. Items in the high-value, high-feasibility quadrant are potential good places to start. You'll want a small but politically-effective number of stakeholders in this meeting; too many and it will be hard for the group to make decisions. too few and they won't be informed enough to make good decisions.</p>
<p>This process requires you and the stakeholders to discuss how each of the opportunities might be met; what improvement (feature or change) would deliver the desired benefit. So we are sneakily involving the knowledgeable stakeholders in choosing improvements to deliver the benefits. They will feel useful pressure to help come up with high-feasibility ways to address high-value items.</p>
<p>Some items will be high-feasibility but low-value. These are nice-to haves that probably should not appear in the ultimate roadmap. Put them in a parking lot so that no one need be sad about them being cut outright. Still others are both low-feasibility and low-value. The stakeholders might have pet items among these. They should also go to the parking lot unless great ideas come up about how to rethink them, their value and feasibility jumps as a result, and the prior research supports their inclusion.</p>
<p>The themes that emerge from looking at the high-value, high-feasibility items are more informative than the rough themes we offered in the investigation phase, and will govern the arrangement of opportunities in the roadmap. And when you look at them you will likely see that some of these themes contain more high scoring items than others.</p>
<p>Offer these themes and the improvements they contain to the stakeholders in a workshop, and ask them to put these themes in order. If we could work on just one theme, which theme would we choose? That one will be first. By the end of the workshop you'll have themes in a rough sequence, and within these their opportunities in a rough sequence.</p>
<p>You could stop here, but it is likely that the stakeholders aren't done yet.</p>
<h3>3. Negotiation</h3>
<p>Now that you have a sequence of themes, and within those a sequence of improvements, you have a roadmap. But it puts some lower-feasibility items ahead of others just because of the themes they appear in. It also may offer a sequence that is awkward to accomplish, or doesn't begin addressing top organizational goals early enough. Time for negotiation.</p>
<ol>
<li>In a workshop with stakeholders, negotiate tradeoffs in improvement sequencing to better meet organizational goals.</li>
<li>Once that negotiation is complete, in that same workshop select one or a few items earliest in the sequence to make up the initial project.</li>
<li>Then go away and plan and estimate the cost in time and treasure to effect that project.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have the right small group of stakeholders, they'll notice that they can rearrange some items to have the roadmap better address systems, efficiency, or political factors, start delivering against key goals sooner, or have certain improvements essentially make decisions early that will be helpful when tackling later improvements. Let them make these tradeoffs. The integrity of the themes is not important; we used the themes as a tool to make the rough sequence easier to accomplish.</p>
<p>After the tradeoffs are done, look to the items at the early end of the roadmap for the scope of the first project. It is tempting to bite off too much; everyone is excited about all the things you're planning to do together. It's best to keep the scope of the first increment small, achievable, not too expensive. Short projects with narrow scopes are more likely to succeed, after all.</p>
<h2>Why not define an ideal?</h2>
<p>You'll note that this process does not define an ideal end state nor attempt to arrange a roadmap to produce that end state. End-state-based design is interesting (and there's a very nice process called Ideality that depends on an understanding of the ideal), but I've elected not to make use of it here. There are several reasons for this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing an expression of an ideal end state, when there are lots of potential improvements, is expensive.</li>
<li>The sequence of roadmap items aimed at an end state is likely to be different than a value- and feasibility-weighted roadmap which leads to high value improvements more quickly.</li>
<li>Understanding and acceptance of an ideal end state tends to decay rapidly as business conditions change and new information and technology becomes available.</li>
<li>Commitment to an end state reduces optionality, the ability of the organization to make new decisions about the future as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, this roadmapping process relies on the improvements themselves and especially benefits they are intended to deliver to take the place of an ideal end-state. These benefits express the desirable future in a diffuse, less-specific manner. Indeed, the later and less-feasible an item on the roadmap the less likely it is to be developed. this is true fo end-state-based roadmapping as well; the likelihood that the organization will pursue the entire roadmap diminishes over time. Why not embrace this constraint?</p>

            <pubDate>Sat May 15 2021 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I contacted seven recruiters I had recently communicated with by whatever means we had spoken before. Most of them wanted to take the discussion to phone or a video chat, but for scheduling reasons I had to steer the discussion to email. Two were confused, one didn't respond, and four said things that were helpful.</p>
<h2>Three types of recruiters</h2>
<p>My respondents agreed on three types of recruiters and their differences:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Contingency recruiter</strong> – this recruiter gets paid a percentage of the your first-year base salary upon hire. It's a numbers game: most of the candidates they offer to companies don't pan out, so they have to rapidly evaluate and offer a lot of companies a lot of candidates to make their time pay off. These recruiters have the least knowledge of the hiring company and the role, and may not even have a contractual relationship with the target company. They have little influence on the target company's decision and do the lest legwork to make sure there's a good fit. You can find a job with the help of a contingency recruiter, but they are helping the company only minimally and want to get you to an interview as fast as possible, not as well as possible. They specialize in individual contributor or low-level managerial roles, where the numbers of applications and opportunities are both high. Their tools are primarily keyword searches on large recruiting platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc. This recruiter consumes job ads posted by companies and in-house recruiters. A solid LinkedIn profile that discusses the right keywords, and a resume that mirrors, it are keys to success with this group.</li>
<li><strong>In-house recruiter</strong> – this recruiter is paid a salary by the hiring company, or is a contractor for them, and works solely on that one company's behalf. They typically know the hiring manager and have worked with the hiring manager to refine their own evaluation of candidates. They may look at portfolios if they feel comfortable, and will read more deeply into a candidates profile so that they can filter more carefully and reflect that they have done this work to the hiring manager. They exert a little more influence in the hiring process, and work on positions at any level up to and including middle management. This recruiter posts job ads, sometimes in specialized locations. They do keyword searches to sweep up a lot of profiles, then comb through these to create a smaller volume of potential fits for the role. A solid LinkedIn profile that discusses the right results, and a resume that mirrors it, plus some evidence of the same in a portfolio, are keys to success with this group.</li>
<li><strong>Retained search recruiter</strong>, sometimes known as &quot;executive search&quot; – this recruiter is paid up-front to fill an important position, and if they are doing their job well will have a relationship with the hiring manager, understand much more about the company and the position, and will be working from a &quot;spec&quot; that is much more detailed than a job description. The hiring company may have told them to favor candidates who have worked at similar companies, competitors, or places that are doing work that the company wants to do. They often understand team dynamics and the political situation at the company that the candidate would become part of. As a result they must do much more up-front assessment, understanding the profile and portfolio and doing much more in-depth screening interviews before offering a candidate to the hiring manager. They are a true gatekeeper in the process. This recruiter typically does not post job ads. The ability to do fine in a basic interview without warning, plus a resume and portfolio that display the necessary skills and acumen, are essential to success with this group.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can tell what sort of recruiter you are dealing with in part by the level of information they provide and their ability to answer questions. If they can't say much more than you can read from the job description, or deflect questions about the role with a &quot;that's a great question for the hiring manager,&quot; you're dealing with a contingency recruiter. It's up to you to look at the company and decide if you'd like them to send your profile to the hiring manager. If you are approached by the recruiter they could be in-house or retained. If there's no job ad and they interview you while telling you about the position, they are likely retained.</p>
<p>To be fair, all recruiters will try to qualify you, will try to make sure you are articulate and interested in the right things, are open to the salary and duties the company is offering, and are willing to take the next step in the process. But they will spend different amounts of time on that, and that time scales directly with how helpful they are to the hiring manager and to you.</p>
<h2>My assumptions</h2>
<p>My respondents also agreed with some of my assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I assumed that a hiring manager who is not a product person will be seeking to add or improve the design function in their organization by hiring a seasoned leader who can evaluate current staff and processes, develop staff, hire, improve processes, improve integration of the design function with the rest of the business, bring new capabilities to the design function, and deliver results in doing so that clearly further the aims of the business.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was unanimously supported.</p>
<ul>
<li>I assumed that a hiring manager who is a product person will have goals for the improvement of the design function, but will not be able to accomplish it on their own due to too many people and/or product lines to support, rapid growth, expertise or interest gaps, or other structural challenges. They may have a strong sense of the signals they are looking for, but regardless of that will be helped by clarity that I can tick all the boxes as a design leader.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was unanimously supported.</p>
<p>My respondents were not in unanimous agreement about other assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I assumed that a recruiter is going to try to match my profile to the “spec” they are given, either a job description or something more specific about the signals the hiring manager is looking for. So a recruiter will be looking for these signals in my resume, and possibly in my portfolio. They are not likely to be expert in experience design, so the recruiter will be watching for general quality of portfolio items and that the right topics are mentioned or otherwise evident.</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned that successful retained search recruiters will have more expertise in the role of the target, and some in-house recruiters, especially for large firms, also specialize. These people will evaluate portfolios with a critical eye and set aside candidates that don't seem to have relevant experience, much as a hiring manager doing their own recruiting would. In addition, retained and in-house recruiters will also be looking for credibility in the treatment of topics such as design thinking, design systems, and process. Portfolios that demonstrate these are seen as more valuable even if the general quality of work is less-well understood by an individual recruiter.</p>
<ul>
<li>I assumed that whether a recruiter is the first hurdle or not, the needs of the different types of hiring manager will be essentially the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>In smaller organizations the hiring manager may do their own recruiting, and will have less patience to go through many profiles in depth. You're likely to be quickly rejected if your fitness as a candidate isn't immediately apparent. As the hiring manager rises in the ranks of a hiring company, the importance of each hire increases but their ability to spend a lot of time on recruiting falls, making it increasingly important that profiles advanced by the recruiter are high quality. So the interesting difference is less the hiring managers' needs (all hiring managers need quality applicants) and more the level of assistance they are given (or can afford).</p>
<h2>For me</h2>
<p>I also asked these recruiters about my own profile. They found the following items important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience with hardware and software</li>
<li>Experience managing cross-functional teams</li>
<li>Evidence of design thinking</li>
<li>Roadmap or other work to inform or assist product management</li>
<li>Evidence of process – <em>this was fine but there could be more</em></li>
<li>Direct-to-consumer work – <em>one recruiter felt this was lacking, which probably means I didn't portray the audiences adequately</em></li>
<li>Evidence of design systems – <em>this was lacking somewhat</em></li>
<li>Evidence of design workshops – <em>this was lacking somewhat</em></li>
<li>Client-facing work – <em>this was lacking</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I note that none of the recruiters mentioned other joys of mine, such as developing design talent, integrating research into company decision-making, mentorship of designers and managers, or harnessing existing data sources to improve products. I could usefully make more of these points. I should <em>not</em> write a lot more in portfolio pieces or resume entries to try to fill in these gaps; every word should do hard work, especially in these settings. Too much prose won't be read at all. So I'll need to find other ways to accomplish this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recruiters I've recently spoken to about passive opportunities (where the recruiter reached out to me before I was aware of the position) are more accessible to me than hiring managers, so my research will have to start there. In a previous article I said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step in capturing passive opportunities is clearly to get my profile in front of relevant recruiters. LinkedIn seems pretty good for this. While my LinkedIn profile is also not a subject of this research, I'm sure I'll learn things relevant to it along the was as well.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The questions raised here include</p>
<ul>
<li>Is LinkedIn a good way to get my profile in front of recruiters?</li>
<li>Does my resume do a good job of getting the recruiter to pass my profile on to the hiring manager?</li>
<li>Does my portfolio do a good job of getting the recruiter to pass my profile on to the hiring manager?</li>
</ul>
<p>But of course these are not the sorts of questions I can usefully ask directly; the likely answers (yes or no) wouldn't improve my understanding much or help me make changes. Instead, I should ask questions that will help me gauge the effectiveness of what I have, provide details that may lead me toward changes, and identify what is already working. These questions will look more like</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of my assumptions are off base? (with a list of these assumptions)</li>
<li>For the position in question, did you have any misgivings about my profile, other than location?</li>
<li>What seemed most relevant about my profile?</li>
<li>What seemed to be missing?</li>
<li>Did you review my portfolio?</li>
</ul>
<p>This sort of question will ideally not be too much to answer, and spark a little conversation that will help me know what to keep or play up in my profile, what to give more emphasis, and where I've left gaps. But first I must get them to engage, so I'll contact them via LinkedIn with a simple message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, [name]. I've decided to turn my design research powers on my portfolio and resume. I'd love to ask you a few questions, since we recently discussed a position. If you are willing, I promise to make it easy and not take up too much of your time. Yes? Thanks, —Jon</p>

<p><strong>My highest-level goal</strong> is to be an impressive candidate design leader to firms that are looking for experience design leadership.

</blockquote>
<p>I'd like my portfolio to represent me well for advertised positions that I apply to, and for positions where a recruiter comes to me as a passive candidate. These two avenues probably have different processes and slightly different audiences. I'm a little bit more interested in the passive opportunities, since recently these have been the more interesting ones (iRobot, Neato, Kohler), but I suspect that there will be goals enough in common that I can do a good job for each audience with one portfolio. (For now I'm going to leave <a href="https://misc.jonplummer.com/JonPlummer.pdf">my resume</a> out of the analysis and research, though I am sure I will learn things that are useful to improving it along the way.)</p>
<p>Since I have some experience recruiting designers and managers in small and large companies, I understand that the key variables and audiences break down like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>When applying to an advertised position, one's profile is screened
<ul>
<li>first by a recruiter, then passed to a hiring manager for further review, OR</li>
<li>first by a hiring manager who <em>is</em> a &quot;product person&quot; (knowledgeable about experience design or product management), OR</li>
<li>first by a hiring manager who <em>is not</em> a product person (focused on some other area such as engineering, sales, or marketing and less knowledgeable about experience design or product management).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A passive candidate's profile is first screened by a recruiter, then
<ul>
<li>reviewed by a hiring manager who <em>is</em> a product person, OR</li>
<li>reviewed by a hiring manager who <em>is not</em> a product person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step in capturing passive opportunities is clearly to get my profile in front of relevant recruiters. LinkedIn seems pretty good for this. While my LinkedIn profile is also not a subject of this research, I'm sure I'll learn things relevant to it along the was as well.</p>
<p>The second is to get that recruiter to invite me to an interview so I can get them to pass me to the hiring manager if the position seems to be a fit. My impression is that my resume does an okay job here, and my portfolio could do better. I don't know how many good opportunities have not come my way due to insufficiency of my portfolio, and I'm not sure I have a way of finding out.</p>
<p>The third is for my profile and the assessment of the recruiter to work together to encourage the hiring manager to grant me an interview. My impression is that my portfolio is not effective in this third step.</p>
<p>I'm going to have to make some more assumptions here, but my strategy should not be informed solely by assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <strong>a recruiter</strong> is going to try to match my profile to the &quot;spec&quot; they are given, either a job description or something more specific about the signals the hiring manager is looking for. So a recruiter will be looking for these signals in my resume, and possibly in my portfolio. They are not likely to be expert in experience design, so the recruiter will be watching for general quality of portfolio items and that the right topics are mentioned or otherwise evident. <strong>I'd like to test this assumption, learn if it is correct and how I might address it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <strong>a hiring manager who <em>is not</em> a product person</strong> will be seeking to add or improve the design function in their organization by hiring a seasoned leader who can evaluate current staff and processes, develop staff, hire, improve processes, improve integration of the design function with the rest of the business, bring new capabilities to the design function, and deliver results in doing so that clearly further the aims of the business. <strong>I'd like to test this assumption.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <strong>a hiring manager who <em>is</em> a product person</strong> will have goals for the improvement of the design function, but will not be able to accomplish it on their own, due to too many people and/or product lines to support, rapid growth, expertise or interest gaps, or other structural challenges. They <em>may</em> have a strong sense of the signals they are looking for, but regardless of that will be helped by clarity that I can tick all the boxes as a design leader. <strong>I'd like to test this assumption.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <strong>whether a recruiter is the first hurdle or not</strong>, the needs of the different types of hiring manager will be the same. This assumption feels pretty safe, if the above hypotheses hold.</p>
<p>So, how might I test my assumptions for each of the three audiences? What might my research plan be for these three audiences?</p>
<p>Often in design research we look where the light is best. Folks like to complain about this; it's a bad way to look for your keys, for example. But needs must; we may not have direct access to the people we need to learn from. In this case, I do not have direct access to hiring managers of either type that I have recently succeeded or failed with, other than my current boss. I do have access to the recruiters I've spoken to recently. I can start with them.</p>
<p>These recruiters are busy people, so I'll need to interrogate them gently and in ways that don't feel expensive to them in terms of time or thought. But I can send an email asking if they'd be willing to answer a few questions by email about the recruiting process and my case in particular, and see what they say.</p>
<p>Next up: the message and the results.</p>

            <title>Results of trying more explicit dimensions on employee reviews</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while ago I resolved to use explicit dimensions to solicit peer feedback and to organize my feedback on employees I needed to review. I also said that I'd let you know how it goes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quality</strong> – HMT (how might they) contribute to better results for the users of the product/project</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong> – HMT improve the delivery of their own work</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong> – HMT foster greater collaboration among the team</p>
<p><strong>Client</strong> – HMT better serve the needs of the client</p>
<p><strong>Improvement</strong> – where have we noticed improvement in the review period</p>
<p>My previous post: <a href="https://jonplummer.local/2020/11/26/reviews/">Reviews</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've done two such reviews this way so far, incorporating these dimensions into the existing structure.</p>
<p>Peer feedback quality was greatly improved. Not everyone had something to say for each dimension, but when they did it was more useful and a nice mix of specific praise and specific constructive feedback. And the recipients of the feedback noticed and appreciated this difference. Granted, the prior peer feedback solicitation questions were pretty slim, essentially &quot;do you have any constructive feedback for {person}&quot; and &quot;do you have any other feedback for {person}?&quot; So anything might be better.</p>
<p>In each review I've gone over the peer feedback and my own thoughts for each dimension, and brought key points for praise and development in the summary. Employees have found this helpful, and the specificity (both topic and feedback) sparked good discussion. Granted, without the usual tight connection of the review to compensation there was less pressure on the employee's part to maneuver the discussion toward whatever would get them the biggest raise. We were free to talk about the future, informed by the past, rather than be tempted to merely put the bravest face we could on the past.</p>
<p>There's an opportunity to reinforce team or company values, or other desired behaviors, with review dimensions such as these. As we hammer out which behaviors these are, I expect the dimensions will change. For now I'll go on using them as-is, as they have already been bearing fruit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm not in a big hurry to leave my job (hi, folks!). But every once in a while a really nice opportunity comes along, and I'd like to be prepared for it. And of late I've felt that I'm not prepared. I think my portfolio doesn't reflect my value as a design leader; it's only a little bit past a designer portfolio, and a hastily thrown-together one at that. Sure, it was sufficient to get my current gig, but I fell into the lap of this company at JUST the right moment; a lot of this last transition is down to good luck.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a good reminder that you should be looking for your next job before you want your next job.</p>
<p>Roy Rapoport, Director of Corporate Engineering at Netflix</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently we've started to revamp the company site, which has gone untouched for half a decade. In doing so we've selected two audiences we want to impress based on our business goals, done research on each, and penned some aims and a mission for the site based on that research and some hopefully reasonable assumptions when research didn't suffice.</p>
<p>I'll take a similar approach, at least conceptually, to improve my own portfolio, using my own goals (why have a portfolio site, after all?) and what I've learned in my many contacts with recruiters and hiring managers over the past few years. Over several posts I'll go through the process, and eventually arrive at a portfolio site that I am proud of and I expect will do the job.</p>
<p><strong>My highest-level goal</strong> is to be an impressive candidate design leader to firms that are looking for experience design leadership. They needn't work hard to qualify themselves; I'll assess these companies myself for culture, personal growth opportunity, financial opportunity, and interesting work to do.</p>
<p><strong>My design leadership portfolio will contribute to that goal by</strong> suggesting to recruiters and hiring managers looking for a product design leader at the director level or better that I am worth further evaluation and an interview.</p>
<p><strong>It'll do so by</strong> demonstrating that my teams make great experiences for normal people in software, hardware, out-of-box, and services.</p>
<p><strong>It'll do so by</strong> showing how my organization of the team, the process, and the work, and my wrangling of the particular challenges of each project, contributed to outstanding results.</p>
<p><strong>It'll do so by</strong> reflecting how I lead teams to use research, usability testing, and metrics to produce good experiences and improve them over time, and where organizational failure to do these things left money and opportunities on the table.</p>
<p><strong>It'll do so by</strong> making it clear that I'm concerned with exactly the things that a growing business needs to pay attention to, including</p>
<ul>
<li>delivering delight,</li>
<li>becoming recommendable,</li>
<li>demonstrating thoughtfulness through meaningful differentiation,</li>
<li>avoiding churn, cancellations, returns, and support costs, and</li>
<li>demonstrating continuous improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, <strong>it'll do so by</strong> demonstrating that mentoring and developing designers, writers, researchers, and accessibility specialists is a part of the job that I find important, enjoy, and am successful at.</p>
<p>These writings have a part to play, of course. My ability to explain concepts, reveal my thinking, and work in public are all facets of my work personality that are material to whatever success I've had so far. So it'll be a help if these sometimes refer to the portfolio and vice versa.</p>
<p>Equally important are <strong>non-goals</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>While I know a bit about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and cut my teeth on CSS back when we were rebuilding table-based layouts without tables, it's <em>not</em> important that I showcase particular skill with these tools. So I don't need to shy away from tools that make producing a site easier. I don't need to hand-roll everything.</li>
<li>While I'm a design leader, I'm not producing a lot of shipping design myself; rather I'm helping teams of people think about and organize their work, and developing those people and the processes in which they operate, to deliver excellent experiences that drive business results. So I need just enough polish to demonstrate thoughtfulness and get my points across. I <em>don't</em> need to create a truly bespoke design. The content will matter more, and team results will matter more, than the frame in which these are shown.</li>
<li>I've learned that designer-manager positions often become one or the other to the dissatisfaction of everyone. I know that what I love is coaching, up and down, and I don't want a player-coach role. So while my own design aptitude is important, my individual work <em>should</em> take a back seat to the results I lead cross-functional teams to achieve. My own sketches to help foster that achievement may have a role to play, however.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I'll need to select projects and produce case studies that provide opportunities to do these things, and be explicit in pointing these things out as I go.</p>
<p>Along the way I'd like to do things a little differently. I'd like to share credit, perhaps by naming people who played a special role on the team. I'd like to discuss the sort of culture I hope to foster on design teams, where the team makes decisions together, knowingly for the good of users and the business, and sign-off by a superior is neither necessary nor sought. And I'd like to set myself up for regular maintenance of the portfolio, such that it's not burdensome to add to it over time. I'd rather not go through a spasm of intense work as I have at each major job transition in the past; rather I'd like a small amount of continuous effort to result in my preparedness for these transitions when the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>What's next? I can see a handful of needed activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product-managing the various possible portfolio pieces</li>
<li>Considering overall positioning and messages that reflect that positioning</li>
<li>Selecting and preparing to measure the appropriate primary actions that denote success for the site</li>
</ul>
<p>It's probably sensible to go after the hardest part first: the portfolio pieces. Watch this space.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm not a fan of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com">LessWrong</a> – while I like the idea of being more rational, and strive to acknowledge and feel my emotions but not let them impede my thinking needlessly, there's a strong whiff of holier-than-thou coming off of many in the rationalist community, including the otherwise very interesting <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2021/01/21/introducing-astral-codex-ten/">Scott Alexander</a>, whose writings on mental health care I admire. A little humility goes a long way but it is sometimes in short supply.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I was happy to read <a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-researcher-anna-salamon/">Anna Salamon</a>’s article <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PBRWb2Em5SNeWYwwB/humans-are-not-automatically-strategic">Humans are not automatically strategic</a>. Though the article makes heavy use of the trope of calling the less-rational populace &quot;humans,&quot; as if rationalists are somehow better than <em>mere humans</em>, the core of the piece lays out an eight step process to develop and pursue goals that is very much like the method I came to the hard way over many years, and try to coach the people I support into using.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) Ask ourselves what we’re trying to achieve; (b) Ask ourselves how we could tell if we achieved it (“what does it look like to be a good comedian?”) and how we can track progress; (c) Find ourselves strongly, intrinsically curious about information that would help us achieve our goal; (d) Gather that information (e.g., by asking as how folks commonly achieve our goal, or similar goals, or by tallying which strategies have and haven’t worked for us in the past); (e) Systematically test many different conjectures for how to achieve the goals, including methods that aren’t habitual for us, while tracking which ones do and don’t work; (f) Focus most of the energy that *isn’t* going into systematic exploration, on the methods that work best; (g) Make sure that our &quot;goal&quot; is really our goal, that we coherently want it and are not constrained by fears or by uncertainty as to whether it is worth the effort, and that we have thought through any questions and decisions in advance so they won't continually sap our energies; (h) Use environmental cues and social contexts to bolster our motivation, so we can keep working effectively in the face of intermittent frustrations, or temptations based in hyperbolic discounting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Point (a) seems to be where so many people fail. What is it that you want? What should happen? If it were magic, where would we be already? Some of this is using question (b) to back into (a), which can be easier, sometimes. But (b) is really about measurement—making your goal operational.</p>
<p>(C) and (d) are research. People often forget to do this, or find it unexciting. That could be a clue that you're not as interested in your goal as you thought (see point (g)), but in these times many find our intellectual persistence has been weakened by the many available distractions of social media, especially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a> that comes with that. It's all to easy to envy or look down on anyone you come across on Twitter, Instagram, etc. and it doesn't help you be you if you are buys inspecting others.</p>
<p>(E), systematically test many different conjectures, is an advanced form of what I wish people. would do, which is <em>just try something and see how it goes</em>. That makes a lightweight form of (f) possible—<em>see if what you are trying is working</em>, and make a change if not, based on (b). (H) is similarly advanced. A lighter form of this, more than adequate to start, is to take notes on your plan and results so you can refer to them later, and do so.</p>
<p>Any creative professional (and I use the term broadly) eventually needs to create a system for themselves (or adopt and then adapt one) to organize their thoughts and plans. One's head is the least reliable storage. Doing so can help make <em>being strategic</em> possible.</p>

            <title>What is a business case?</title>

            <pubDate>Fri Jan 22 2021 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To me, someone who didn't go to business school, the all-too-common admonition to “make the business case&quot; for something was often a showstopper. What is a business case, what does it include, how do I make one, and what hard questions need be answered when making it? I had no idea where to start. And even my best bosses were no real help, handwaving vaguely about time and costs and benefits and whatnot.</p>
<p>It turns out that, aside from some large businesses that have a very specific format for an internal proposal, they were handwaving vaguely because they didn't have anything more specific to say, and because some of their words carried meaning that wasn't obvious.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to figure this out. I finally pinned someone down while I was early at Belkin and fairly interrogated them about the &quot;business case&quot; that seemed so daunting throughout my career, and learned that there's not really much to it. <em>You</em> could bash together a business case for whatever without too much trouble, I bet.</p>
<p>Sure, there's the matter of <em>benefit</em>—that's a bit of business jargon that refers to the desirable result of doing a thing, said in a way that doesn't depend on how it is achieved. For example, we would like to have a more inclusive workplace. There are lots of things we could do to get there. Improving the inclusion of underrepresented groups in our hiring pipeline is one tactic we might use to help achieve that benefit.</p>
<p>So this business about benefit, time, cost, etc. is correct, and really about expressing a problem, a benefit to counter the problem, and then offering possible methods and their costs that will help achieve the benefit.</p>
<p>I wrote a little memory jogger to help build these. It's not much to look at; I'll bet you can fill it out pretty easily as you think about a problem you are trying to solve. A simple proposal, not too expensive or time consuming, can be just this in an email. A fancy proposal will need more flesh, but the anatomy is the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have (problem) It costs us this (in treasure, pain, missed opportunities)</p>
<p>A way forward is (solution) It will cost us (how much) to get started (in treasure, people, space, equipment, etc.) In the first (timeframe) it will yield (result), based on (the similar experience of others) Ideal for us is if it ramps to producing (result) Other opportunities it might create include (stretch)</p>
<p>There’s also (alternative solution) It’s better than the other (because) It’s worse than the other (because) It will cost us (how much) to get started (in treasure, people, space, equipment, etc.) In the first (timeframe) it will yield (result), based on (the similar experience of others) Ideal for us is if it ramps to producing (result) Other opportunities it might create include (stretch) Etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any part of this you can’t answer can be answered with the help of folks in your organization, folks you know or learn about via working the network, or can be left asked but unanswered. You'll need to talk to these people anyhow to gather support for your proposal, so you might as well include them early—involving people in creating the future that they will be part of is really the only good way to create buy-in.</p>
<p>Recently I've started to knock this sort of thing together into a little proposal format. It doesn't match the above exactly, but you'll recognize the themes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A specific and action-oriented name for the initiative</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Explain the situation that gives rise to the problem and any useful facts about the situation that will be good to know as people read through the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>Express the specific problem you’d like to go after, more plainly and directly than suggested in Background.</p>
<p><strong>Our Aim</strong></p>
<p>State the desired benefit. For example, <em>Elevate the average employee’s awareness of inclusive work culture and behavior, and equip them to participate in small local interventions when necessary.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proposed Intervention</strong></p>
<p>Explain the concrete steps you plan to take to achieve the benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Cost and timeframe</strong></p>
<p>Talk about what it would cost, and how long it would take, to do those steps. Consider initial costs, recurring costs, whether we're &quot;done” at some point. Bonus points if the costs and time line up exactly with the activities in the proposed intervention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That should be enough to get most ideas out of your head and into active discussion in your company, club, homeowners association, etc.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You'd be forgiven for thinking my employer doesn't have a blog. It (and the website it's a part of) haven't been updated in a while, and while the content is interesting, it's a little wooden and sparsely published, to the tune of an article or two per year in past years, and none this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Thought leadership&quot; is a line item on every director's or VP's job description, and we're told it is important. The suggested ways to demonstrate thought leadership are by the blog, giving conference talks, and by participating in standards committees (useful for our edtech products and clientele). A very few people are in position to participate in the standards committees, and the rest of us are not holding up our end.</p>
<p>You'll probably see why, looking at our posts. Their length and production value is fairly high, with illustrations and pull quotes and tight editing to reflect the company voice and tone. They fit into a fairly narrow band of design and development process and technique, with some loftier edtech concepts and product announcements rounding out the list. And I'm told they take weeks to produce and go through a fairly strict approvals process.</p>
<p>At some point soon I'll be on the hook for a revised &quot;thought leadership strategy,&quot; an assignment I made up and gave myself because I don't find this situation satisfying, and because I think that our ethos of continuous improvement leads us to experiment with techniques, tools, and process all the time so we are always learning. And we're not just learning about edtech standards or design and development technique; we're operating on team processes, people management, equity and inclusion, social responsibility, accessibility and usability, research and discovery, client management, pattern-oriented design, staff development. We are chewing on every part of the business we are in. So chances are we have lots to say. And we'd like to put not just <em>a</em> human face, but <em>real human faces</em> on our work and the portrayal of our company.</p>
<p>The past manner of producing blog posts looks to me like a series of expensive hurdles between a person who is eager to share something they've learned or realized or succeeded at and a far-off blog post that's going to be enough work to squelch the impulse. But perhaps we can overturn these hurdles. Maybe we can &quot;what if&quot; them away.</p>
<p>What would it be like if we didn't have an extensive approvals process? What if instead we had guidelines, and helped people to comply with them when they were not? That would probably be easier for everyone, and we could update the guidelines as we learned from the process.</p>
<p>What would it be like if, instead of tightly editing each post to fit into the company voice and tone, we let the voice of the author shine through? We could edit for clarity and basic grammar and be done with it. The voice would be the person's, the tone would be appropriate to the material (and we may have some weighty topics to discuss; no need to force everything to be technical or lighthearted), and the people will see their own expression, personality, and esteem in the posts they produce.</p>
<p>What would it be like if, instead of having to present news (we launched!) or a fully-fledged method or conclusion, we were to talk about things we were trying to do, or learning about, or experimenting with? We might not feel so called to present a federal case about a technique we had chosen and then feel stuck with it.</p>
<p>What would it be like if we opened up the allowable topics to cover essentially anything we were learning or experimenting with at work? Folks on my team are wresting with including a blind person into the design process, bringing content-first techniques to data-driven tools, packaging research as a product, bringing clients to rapid usability testing in the midst of short sprints, development of junior staff, and many more interesting topics. We may not always have something completely new to say about these things, but we can talk about what we are trying and, later, what happened and what we'll try next.</p>
<p>What would it be like if, instead of insisting that posts be weighty, we were to allow short ones? A paragraph or two about things learned when discussing a meaty topic might be just as valuable as, and a ton easier to bang out than, a lengthier, lighthearted post about a nice result we have produced for a client.</p>
<p>Imagine a company where essentially any employee, not just a few in the management class, has the ability to post, and knows how to make a good post. We might have a process by which a person, inspired by a meeting or with a fresh thought about an experiment we should do, could bang out a quick post before the rush fades, and we can make up for a few high-production-value posts with a flood of smart thoughts from real people, trying hard every day, if we manage to release each of these brakes.</p>

            <title>My note to Mr. Bias</title>

            <pubDate>Mon Dec 07 2020 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Bias wanted folks to look over his new portfolio, and I was happy to help. He's a new UX/UI Designer and what little appears on <a href="https://www.tbias.design/">his site</a> is promising. Here's what I had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there.</p>
<p>I like a lot of what you have here, and you were smart to grab your own domain name. I'm sure it'll look more impressive once you have a couple more projects on there.</p>
<p>As a hiring manager (who is, alas, not hiring at the moment) I'm interested in</p>
<ul>
<li>seeing what your contribution to the project was (especially your THINKING contribution to the project)</li>
<li>seeing how decisions were made and what you learned along the way</li>
<li>seeing those insights made visible in the mockups or prototypes</li>
</ul>
<p>I even have a rubber stamp that I use on resumes to see what characteristics or capabilities I can find clues about in a person's materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research (user research and secondary research)</li>
<li>Prototyping (self-explanatory)</li>
<li>Testing (user testing!)</li>
<li>Graphics (not a strict requirement for a UX role, but often helpful)</li>
<li>Delivery (quality of deliverables – are they organized, explanatory, easy to follow)</li>
<li>Communication (is organized thinking made obvious in speech and writing)</li>
<li>and bonus skills (is there anything else this person can do that might be useful or reflects intellectual curiosity)</li>
</ul>
<p>So I'm watching for signs of people being interested in these topics, doing them, and hopefully doing them well or progressively better. Happily all of these things are expressible or at least hintable in an online portfolio such as yours.</p>
<p>Your writeup for Pay the Poet is straightforward and sensible, but it leaves me wanting a little bit more re the above items, especially what you (or the team) learned. I think this is mainly because you have some fairly uninformative statements in there such as &quot;Poets love the Instagram UI.&quot; This is a bit of a &quot;so what&quot;—what do they love about the UI? Emotionally, functionally, etc.? You do mention that they are used to Insta's upload interface, which is specific. Specificity, plainly spoken, is your friend here.</p>
<p>Another, &quot;PayPal is a popular and secure method of payment that users trust&quot; hints that there's more there, but you don't go further. What other payment vehicles did you ask about? Is anything important beyond trust?</p>
<p>These things seem to me pretty easy to fix, but will require some introspection.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there's a whole line of inquiry that could be useful to discuss coming off of &quot;Poets want exposure and a means to build a following.&quot; This is the sort of meaty starting point for an interesting app + service. Right after that you say &quot;Poets want to be able to connect with fans and those who seek to book them.&quot; I like this one too. I wonder if you have more to say about these.</p>
<p>Take care with statements like &quot;after our first stand-up, we decided to create a screener survey which informed us what type of digital product to create&quot;—a survey never tells you want to do, but that's what you are saying here. My guess is that your interpretation of the survey results gave you clues about the way forward that you then needed to explore, yes? Probably not answers <em>per se</em>.</p>
<p>I like the &quot;How Might We&quot;s and wonder what more you might say about them that's specific.</p>
<p>I like that you called out your specific contributions later on in the write-up. I'm hopeful that your other writeups will show off other capabilities. Early in a UX career there's not much room for specialization.</p>
<p>It would be nice to know what unique or interesting interactions you were attempting to express in your wireframes. Wires on their own are rarely sufficient to explain to a developer what you are trying to make, and I'm watching for clues that you can relate the concepts you've put there in words as well as pictures.</p>
<p>I like that you express some insights from user testing. This is evidence of learning, an important signal for folks beginning their careers.</p>
<p>Did you or the team think of potential future work for this product? Features that aren't core now but might be useful later? This isn't required, but it's a clue that you are thinking about the user's needs and the product outside of the immediate context.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Please feel free to ask me questions if you like.</p>
<p>Also, I dig your About page. There's a kernel in there that might be useful in discussions with hiring managers, or could even get more play elsewhere on your site. Poor UX in software, hardware, services, or what's often called CX (customer experience across channels) leads directly to customer pain and support calls, making products and services less profitable. At Belkin this was a real issue – if we made a design or technical mistake in the setup of a product, each individual call would suck up all of the profit for the device the user had purchased. So there was a lot of pressure to learn about the problems users were bringing to customer service to try to keep costs down through design and development – through improving quality. You are uniquely positioned to make good use of what your brethren in customer service are learning every day from customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the discussion I finally made the point that I seem to have to make with every new designer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can guess that you did a lot of the right activities and learned some stuff when you speak in generalities, but learning and good thinking is made obvious when you speak in specifics. There's something a little bit &quot;college essay&quot; about generalities, and business demands specifics. So if there's something interesting or surprising you learned that mattered to the project, telling me specifically about that, in plain language, is more powerful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that much like with Apple 20-some years ago, the timing will be right for the experience of using something to matter to the point where it changes the equation not just of a market, but of the entire world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe such a change will happen in the enterprise as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He points out that this will likely be a slow process. And it will; it _has_ been a slow process for decades already. The fact that enterprise _buyers_ are often not adept, day-to-day enterprise _users_ has kept focus squarely on development cost at the expense of quality, ease, (ironically) cost of support, and a thousand tiny daily charges against goodwill as people wrestle with awkward enterprise software.</p>
<p>But the shift from in-house enterprise IT to SaaS and managed services has set the table for competition on experience and lower cost of support. SaaS teams with enough _focus_ can compete on experience quality at whatever scale if they remember to continuously reconnect with their users.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At work we are soon to reconsider how we do annual reviews. But we lack a shared sense of why we do them, and they are performed with different levels of seriousness in different parts of this small company.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, signals from leadership are (likely inadvertently) mixed: reviews are important, feedback and development are important, but with raises &quot;sort of on hold&quot; due to the pandemic, reviews are as well. Reviews aren't all about money, but they are suddenly seemingly unimportant and all about money since the money is at issue.</p>
<p>I don't say this to be critical of our leadership; the situation has been come by honestly over a long history. But it's confusing to folks who have not grown up in this particular work culture. This is one of those all-too-frequent situations where a little more professionalism goes a long way.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have people on my team who want to have their reviews, and I want to give them. And I just had my one-year anniversary, and want to have my own review. So we're going to do them unofficially, with the slightly reluctant blessing of the leadership team, separate entirely from thoughts of compensation.</p>
<p>There are nice parts of these reviews: they involve an extensive self-appraisal, they involve peer feedback, they aren't forced into a ranking or a five-point scale. But there are troubles as well. There's little guidance to managers regarding performing these reviews. There's scant relationship between the reviews and the mission or values of the company. And the reviews all end with an overview and compensation discussion with the very busy company president. So the connection between feedback and compensation is starkly underscored.</p>
<p>I'd much rather reviews be separate from compensation, since de-fanging them in this way allows them to lean more fully toward constructive feedback and the future rather than proving that past behavior was worthy of money. And now I have the chance to tilt the few reviews I'll be a part of in this more helpful direction.</p>
<p>The peer feedback is also solicited in a vague way, with essentially two questions: do you have constructive feedback for the reviewee, and do you have any other feedback for the reviewee? I suspect these are not specific enough for any but the most committed peers to do a good job of addressing.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, IDEO likes to evaluate their employees along four dimensions</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content</strong> – what is the quality of a person's delivery</li>
<li><strong>Commerce</strong> – what is their contribution to the success of their clients and the firm</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – what is their manner for working with the teams they are on</li>
<li><strong>Culture</strong> – what is their contribution to the culture of IDEO</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we can adapt this notion – the commerce piece in particular is a little more distant for many of our people. But we could bend it a bit toward</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality</strong> – HMT (how might they) contribute to better results for the users of the product/project</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong> – HMT improve the delivery of their own work</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – HMT foster greater collaboration among the team</li>
<li><strong>Client</strong> – HMT better serve the needs of the client</li>
<li><strong>Improvement</strong> – where have we noticed improvement in the review period</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to try this on by doing my two coming reviews with these dimensions explicitly in mind, and using these to solicit peer feedback. I'll let you know how it goes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear <em>by Humankind</em> folks:</p>
<p>I love what you are doing and have progressively bought more <a href="https://byhumankind.com/">by Humankind</a> products over time (and tried to turn friends on to them). It’s inspired me to find ways to reduce plastic and packaging elsewhere in my life. And it’s also inspired me to consider how things might be redesigned to reduce their throwaway parts. So, if you’re willing, I have some ideas about your deodorant refills and dispenser.</p>
<p>Near as I can tell there are three “throwaway” plastic parts in a deo refill: the carrier, the screw, and the cap.</p>
<p>First up is the cap – it gives the deodorant its nice domed shape, but since you have it mated with a cardboard tube it doesn’t really do that job all that well; there’s always quite a bit of flash around the top of the deodorant, and the cap is sometimes hard to remove (I’m on my third refill, and two of them have took some tugging). So that injection-molded plastic cap could probably be replaced by a cheaper and lighter plastic film or possibly even paper. That would also allow you to get a little more deo material in the refill. The domed shape comes soon enough through use. This change would probably not disrupt any part of the customer experience and certainly wouldn’t demand more from users – in fact, it may be easier for them to use.</p>
<p>Next up is the carrier, which pushes the deodorant up when the screw is turned. This probably can’t be done away with, alas.</p>
<p>Finally, the screw. It’s kind of a big injection-molded part, and cast into the deo material, which makes it easy for users to manage. But depending on the level of work you are willing to ask of your customers, it could be a non-replaced part of the dispenser rather than a replaced and discarded part of the refill. This would require the user to screw the refill onto the knob and screw, then insert that assembly into the sleeve, which is a different and more difficult process. But it would knock off one screw per refill, or about two-fifths of the total plastic per refill. This would be a disruptive change also because you’d have to change dispensers, and thus obsolete and replace a set of existing dispensers. But it might fulfill part of your mission better, if done early enough.</p>
<p>A less-disruptive form of this would be to stop shipping screws in each refill and just have people keep a screw from a previous recent refill – they could screw the screw into a screwless refill, then install it the usual way, and you could ship screws to folks who need them or who buy new dispensers.</p>
<p>An alternative would be to collect all three of these parts, but that would lead to more shipping and you’d have to clean and inspect them before reintroducing them to manufacturing. Better to reduce than reuse.</p>
<p>Anyhow, food for thought. I certainly don’t expect or demand you make any of these changes, but figured you might find these thoughts interesting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>I have near two year experience doing oversea marketing from a leading international NAS company called Synology. My role was devising marketing strategy and implementing it in our New Zealand and Australia market. (These two markets earn Synology over 1 billion revenue annually) I was the only marketing person who looks after these two area, so I have to run user/market research, devise product and content strategies, build campaign website with development, hold offline trade shows, perform copywriting, release product PR/ writeups and strategically distribute all the marketing materials to various channel outlets (including enterprise and consumer channels).</p>
<p>I came across UX in a marketing campaign where I design the website from scratch and attracted millions of impressions within two months. I realized that I’m interested in how experience shapes user behaviors, as well how they make decisions. By looking into users in both qualitative and quantitative lens, I hope I can play a more product-oriented role in a firm. That’s why I decided to pivot my career.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading these long paragraph and would love to hear any suggestions from you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hello, Daphne, Sorry about the delay. I read your note with interest; since you have some experience in product marketing you might be more ready than your peers to engage design goals at a higher level.</p>
<p>Design goals are the marriage of user goals and business goals. The ideal product, design, or business intervention brings success to the person being served and the business doing the serving.</p>
<p>In my early days at a past employer some product management leaders arrived from Procter &amp; Gamble. They brought a method of product definition that changed the way I look at design. To hear them tell it, a solid product concept depends on some insight about a customer, some insight about the competition, and a way of delivering a benefit to that customer in a way that is informed by these insights and thus distinct from your competitors. It may not have a direct competitor at all, if your insights are insightful enough.</p>
<p>An <strong>insight</strong> is a statement of fact about a situation or behavior that is obvious in retrospect, but hidden or overlooked to most observers. An example: if you ask married men in the US why they shave their faces, they may say something about their spouses liking them to have a smooth face. But if you examine common shaving behaviors you'd see these same men shaving on weekday mornings before work, and letting their stubble grow on the weekend, just when they'd be spending the most time with their spouse. Clearly their motivation is elsewhere; it turns out that their behavior demonstrates that they shave to demonstrate a professional appearance at work.</p>
<p>A <strong>benefit</strong> is the result of having or using your product, expressed in general terms. It's especially important that the benefit be a result, rather than a product itself. It's also important that the benefit be expressed in general terms; the benefit could perhaps be delivered by means other than your product. In the shaving example, the benefit of a comfortable, smooth shave every morning could be delivered via a razor, or a shaving powder, or perhaps carefully-targeted lasers. The method is important, but the benefit does not state it.</p>
<p>I mention these product marketing concepts, benefits and insights, because interrogating them can usefully inform the work of product design and help others on the team, such as engineers and QA people, understand the intent behind the product being developed.</p>
<p>Asking about benefits and insights can also help you detect where research may be needed to strengthen the case for a product, to improve the benefit, determine how to demonstrate the benefit, or even where the product management is lacking. It's common for newer product managers to rush headlong into assignments where they are asked to deliver a feature without really delving into the benefit that feature is meant to deliver. During design and development the forces of budget, timeframe, and technology can distort a poorly-understood benefit and put the design and development effort at significant risk. Attention the the benefit, why the benefit is relevant, and the various means available to you of delivering the benefit, can help you craft an intervention that is at the right scale for the business and really meets a customer need.</p>
<p>There's one more product marketing concept that is important here: <strong>reasons to believe</strong>. A reason to believe is a fact about the product that helps the consumer understand that the product really will deliver the benefit it promises. RtBs come in many forms, such as endorsement (Kobe wears these shoes, the American Dental association recommends this toothpaste), explanation (a diagram of the product in use, a video), demonstration (see my white teeth), comparison (this router is 15% faster than the leading brand), proof (clinically proven to reduce cavities), a visible feature, a named feature, reassurance (money-back guarantee), or a testimonial (Joe here really enjoys his stump jumper).</p>
<p>If you are working on a feature for a product, and you understand the benefit, you can more easily give your user the scent of that benefit early in the interaction and demonstrate that you have delivered the benefit later in the interaction. This is just good design practice, but by asking the right questions you can get to a potentially successful design faster.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Velop Whole-Home Wi-Fi System is a collection of identical routers that work together to behave as a single virtual device, blanketing your home in fast and strong Wi-Fi coverage without the usual degradation in speed provided by traditional range extenders. They connect to each other wirelessly over dedicated channels, or can be connected via wire, distributing Wi-Fi radios and Ethernet ports around your home where you need them.</p>

<p><img src="images/SET_260-576x1024.png" alt=""></p>
<p>One Velop node is a very nice Wi-Fi router, and two or three will provide excellent range and speed for larger homes. To make setting up this multi-unit system as straightforward as possible we devised an app-based routine that detects available nodes and offers them to the user, walks them through the minimal wiring tasks necessary, detects their Internet settings, assists with the placement of nodes, and shows their network growing as they succeed in setting up each node in turn.</p>
<p>The industrial design is a strong counterpoint to traditional &quot;dead bug&quot; networking products, incorporating 360° design, thoughtful cable management, and a simple yet informative single LED indicator. This makes for a product that people don't feel they need to hide behind furniture or in a closet. The tall narrow shape has a small footprint, yet elevates internal antennas for the best possible wireless performance.</p>
<p>My role: Software and firmware product owner, and leader of the UX, UI, Industrial Design, and Mechanical Engineering teams. Determined core experiential attributes of product, and served as Scrum product owner on multiple blended teams simultaneously. Developed software roadmap and co-developed hardware roadmap.</p>
<p>Lessons learned: Mixed product ownership is tricky, made less so when the co-owners have distinct areas of focus yet conspire to make a very nice product together. In volleyball one is often told to &quot;improve the ball,&quot; to make the job of those around you at least slightly easier with each touch. If co-owners do this they can make a fine thing, indeed.</p>

<p>My role: Product owner, leader of the design team and cajoler of the software and firmware engineering teams. Substitute product manager for a somewhat neglected area. Part-time scrum master for design and blended design/development teams.</p>
<p>Lessons learned: The performance characteristics of the framework you choose to develop with need to align closely with the performance needs of your product. The framework is meant to make life easier for developers but needs to do so in a way that explicitly conveniences users. Said another way, the negative performance characteristics of the framework you choose better not matter to your users or you've magnified pain of development rather than reduced it. Asking otherwise happy people to review your app, infrequently, increases the recommendability of your product. A fresh coat of paint is not enough, but failing to give a fresh coat of paint once in a while enhances feelings of neglect, deserved or not.</p>

<p>Wemo is a family of intelligent products for the home that allow you to control and see the status of switches, lights, and other devices, via your phone, from anywhere. We started with a plug-in switch module and a motion sensor, then quickly expanded to a power-measuring switch (Wemo Insight), a light switch, various LED lighting products, a heater, humidifier, and slow-cooker, and recently a dimmer. A smaller version of the original switch module, dubbed Wemo Mini, launched at the beginning of 2017.</p>

<p>My role: Made formative experience sketches for the product line that continue to govern the way the system operates, for better or worse. Formed the UX team with select members of my design staff and lead them into designing in a semi-Agile process in order to better integrate with the rapidly-forming software and cloud teams. Groomed one of their number to be the eventual UX manager for Wemo as a reorganization approached so I could turn my attention to rescuing the design and interactive components of the Linksys division.</p>
<p>Lessons learned: You must be clear what the core of your product is, lest you dilute your message in your eagerness to expand the product line. Inappropriate product partners make for messy divorces and disappointed children/employees. People notice if you fail to refresh visually, even as functionality continues to expand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An in-home study requiring participants to replace their existing router with one of three Belkin routers showed us that we had a lot of work to do. People surprised us at every turn, losing instructions, getting turned around in instructions, not understanding which cable was which, plugging things into the wrong places, etc. One nice lady even plugged the power supply cable into the headphone jack on her computer, because it sort of looked like it belonged there and she had missed the step where she was to give power to the new router.</p>
<p>Removing opportunities for mistakes became the order of the day. An order-tolerant setup process, pre-connected cables, and instructions directly on the parts in question scored very well when tested in the lab and among the public when sold. Setup-related support calls were reduced significantly and an entire class of wiring-related calls went nearly to zero.</p>

<p>In addition, we removed several opportunities for mistakes or confusion by shipping the router pre-secured, with a network name and password printed on a card. This could be changed by users at any time or during setup, and included blanks on the back to write their new settings if desired. Later routers included a slot on the foot for the card to be stored. This card significantly reduced the volume of &quot;what's my network password&quot; support calls.</p>
<p>My role: lead designer and usability tester, led diagnostic in-home studies, cajoled Customer Care to analyze and report call data in ways that could spur action among Design and Product Management</p>
<p>Lessons learned: there's always room to reduce opportunities for mistakes. User attention is fragile and singular; you can direct it where you need to, but not too many times. The emotional support role of a setup process dare not be neglected; when done well it inspires confidence in your product. When done poorly the person may not believe your product is working well even when it is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I served on the Belkin Values committee with the CEO, VP of Design, VP of Human Resources, and another designer, with the guidance of the Emotive Brand agency from San Francisco. We aimed to overturn Belkin's prior very pedestrian brand and values statements in favor of discovered values, in-place already, that we felt represented strengths worth emphasizing. It was a grueling process but these values are in use every day and form a meaningful portion of employee evaluations.</p>
<p><img src="images/BelkinValues-640x1024.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>My favorite is &quot;pursue the ideal,&quot; which acknowledges that the ideal is out of reach, and does not ask for optimization of your small area of the business but instead for you to stretch with others to identify and get ever closer to a shared ideal.</p>
<p>Each value is succinct and memorable, and supported by the others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A skunkworks project to make a wearable remote for an insulin pump and glucose sensor, based on an existing LCD driver with limited segment count, led naturally to wondering: what if it were really a watch, that looked and worked like a watch?</p>

<p><img src="images/001.1_idle_-_interrupted_signal.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="images/001.2_alarm_review_-_off.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In 2006 this was a fairly radical thought, especially the digital crown and repurposing existing analog watch behaviors for everyday control.</p>
<p>The initial impulse behind this project was to use a controller capable of driving a limited number of segments (I think it was around 170 segments) to make a watch-like object.</p>
<p><img src="images/0_all_segments.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="images/12_alarm_rise.gif" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="images/13_0_cal_bg.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Along the way I experimented with digital watch-style multi-button control methods as well, but since a working prototype was never made the results were never usability-tested. I did make a non-functional physical prototype much in the manner of an old-school piano practice board.</p>
<p><img src="images/lcdwatchinterfacemap-1024x791.png" alt=""></p>
<p>My role: concepts, interactive specifications, hallway testing with interested employees who were also patients</p>
<p>Lessons learned: there's no substitute for a prototype of any fidelity, and designing for fixed segments is a much different and more limiting beast than pixel-based displays.</p>

            <pubDate>Sun Dec 08 2013 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time) GMT</pubDate>
            
            
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A patient with an insulin pump and a glucose monitor has health data positively streaming off of them, yet endocrinologists typically struggled with the reports they were given, often relying on cruder measures to make behavioral recommendations and rough adjustments to pump settings between quarterly visits. Direct research with five endocrinology offices, which later became a lead user program with two doctors in one office, helped us create a new set of reports aimed squarely at answering key clinical questions and showing patient behavior and results together.</p>
<p><img src="images/daily.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="images/overview.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="images/sensor.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="images/logbook.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="images/adherence.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="images/pump_settings.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Central to these reports is the idea that as a patient takes more fingersticks the analysis should begin to approach that which is possible with a sensor; with a sensor a detailed train of behavior and results should be made clear and scannable.</p>
<p>New (and patented) at this time was a report detailing the adherence level of the patient, a key first glance that suggested to the physician how likely the later reports would be helpful.</p>
<p>Patents (of the type we called &quot;amateur endocrinologists&quot; during our research) have also come to love these reports that are aimed at professionals: <a href="https://rollinginthed.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/the-hook-brings-you-back/">https://rollinginthed.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/the-hook-brings-you-back/</a></p>
<p>My role: research, collection of live patient data, iterative design and testing of report design alternatives with endocrinologists and other physicians, functional specifications</p>
<p>Lessons learned: too-frequent contact with busy physicians can annoy them, but if you actually meet their needs they will adopt your product wholeheartedly and all will be forgiven. Physicians are smart and learned but can't remember everything, so sometimes will have remembered outdated or incorrect lessons of the past. Leading them away from error with data and good design is more effective than arguing with them.</p>
