title: "A common problem with goal-based annual evaluations"

It's common that, once annual review time comes around, you'll be asked to propose some goals for yourself for the coming year and to help the people you support come up with their annual goals. These goals will be used to monitor your and their performance during the year and to evaluate it at the end of the year. It seems to be a bit of managerial and HR orthodoxy about how we evaluate people and how we plan for that evaluation.

It's an approach that is suited to directors and above, who mainly work _on_ the business, and for salespeople whose direct measurement is straightforward. But I find it hard to apply to the designers, developers, QA engineers, writers, etc. that actually make the products that we sell, that work _for_ the business.

A challenge I've faced at each organization I've worked for when setting goals for designers, who should follow a process but are frequently moved among products and subject to the shifting goals of those products, is that it was easy to come up with goals that sat _alongside_ their day-to-day work and thus accidentally NOT provide a way for those designers to succeed by doing a good job on their primary duties. It was easy to think of ways that a designer could contribute to the improvement of process or practice, to change how the team delivers their work, to add a technique to improve the capabilities of the team. These are worthy pursuits, but if this sort of thing represents much of a designer's goals you are suddenly no longer rewarding the designer for a good job designing.
