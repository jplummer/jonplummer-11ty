M.C.Seigler has a [somewhat inspirational take on the Salesforce acquisition of Slack](https://500ish.com/the-way-of-the-future-679697c35f79), namely that

> I believe that much like with Apple 20-some years ago, the timing will be right for the experience of using something to matter to the point where it changes the equation not just of a market, but of the entire world.

And that

> Â I believe such a change will happen in the enterprise as well.

He points out that this will likely be a slow process. And it will; it \_has\_ been a slow process for decades already. The fact that enterprise \_buyers\_ are often not adept, day-to-day enterprise \_users\_ has kept focus squarely on development cost at the expense of quality, ease, (ironically) cost of support, and a thousand tiny daily charges against goodwill as people wrestle with awkward enterprise software.

But the shift from in-house enterprise IT to SaaS and managed services has set the table for competition on experience and lower cost of support. SaaS teams with enough \_focus\_ can compete on experience quality at whatever scale if they remember to continuously reconnect with their users.
