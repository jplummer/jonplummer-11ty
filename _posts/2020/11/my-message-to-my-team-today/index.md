Gentle people,

It's a moment of uncertainty and anxiety (election), piled atop a lengthy period of uncertainty and anxiety (pandemic, police killings, climate change, fires, etc.) with no real end in sight. I get it if you're distracted. It's fineâ€”expected, even.

Be kind to yourself. And if you like, let me be kind to you, too. Let me know if you need help. Need to clear the decks? I can help. Need things to do to be distracted? I can help. Need to get something off your chest? I can help.

Don't want to talk about it? Fine. Want to talk about it? Fine. I'm here for that, either way.

We will gratefully greet the sun in the morning.
