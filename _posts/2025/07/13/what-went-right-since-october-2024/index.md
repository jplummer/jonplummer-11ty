So many things!
- Work
    - I promoted someone
    - I failed to promote someone, but learned a lot and it was the right decision
    - We've had a couple of leadership offsites and they have been both pleasant and valuable
    - I've guided my team from AI-skeptic or AI-agnostic to AI-curious, and written a quick position paper to explain our approach to both using AI tools and designing for AI-powered experiences
    - UX people are strong participants in product trios, at long last
    - We're hiring!
- Home
    - We've caught up on a handful of long-overdue home projects, just in time for the summer heat. Curtains, blinds, gym flooring, patch and paint, more curtainsâ€¦ there's more to do, always, but good progress after a bit of a stall
    - The ADU is now occupied
    - The girl is enjoying her six-week ballet intensive in a far-off state
    - I got my GMRS license. Say hello to WSIX524
    - Mr. Fixit has branched out into a little light metal work including repairing a watering can and making a house key easier for a blind person to use
