I've taken some belated inspiration from [Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org/) and introduced a feature that's new to me: short link posts between "normal" posts. (His look much like normal posts but I didn't want to work that hard.) I now have a way to add short links of interest to the blog; they'll appear in aggregate between the normal posts. Normal posts now end with an end-of-post token borrowed from magazines: a square.

There are a lot of links recently; I hope to keep it to a dull roar but the design world is changing so quickly that there's a lot to learn about.

Posts appear in an RSS feed, found as before at [https://jonplummer.com/feed.xml](https://jonplummer.com/feed.xml), and links now appear in their own feed at [https://jonplummer.com/links-feed.xml](https://jonplummer.com/links-feed.xml). Enjoy!
