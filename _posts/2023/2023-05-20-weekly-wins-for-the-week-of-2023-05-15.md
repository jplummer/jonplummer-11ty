- Quarterly coaching is done. I might be the first to complete it among the managers.
- Our pilot recruiting of prospective research participants (recruit them before you need them) has begun.
- I'm hatching a plot to investigate "diving saves" performed by our support team to find and sell revenue-linked usability project to the PM team. In a moment where general experience improvements are met with skepticism, making the effect on the customer of action or inaction really clear is critical. And I have a handful of ideas where to find other such improvement possibilities.
- I'm feeling mostly ready for our leadership on-site next week (I guess it's an on-site when remote people come together at HQ?) having written and received helpful comments on many pages of pre-read material. A deadline helps!
