- An oft-rescheduled and contentious meeting resulted in a resolution to work together more often and more closely, which is the right answer.

- I made progress on (many of) the things this week!

- By speaking freely about what I'm working on (for a change) I've found folks who are interested in the results, interested in the process, interested in helping, or who might combine their work and mine to make something even more interesting. Of course! Yet I quickly forget that this is usually the case, especially when I'm feeling sheepish about my progress.

- My hygiene and nutrition has been adequate for another trip around the sun. Many happy returns!
