I had a medical…thing…to do on Monday so this was another shortish week, the sort where all the meetings get slid atop one another to occupy available space so you can pretend that it was not a short week. Even so,

- The medical thing went fine. I remember nothing.

- Friday was meeting-light so I got a little bit of non-meeting work done.

- I realized that for a handful of the initiatives I'm on I needn't toil in obscurity but would do better to send async questions to a handful of people, so I did.

- A team-wide message from the CEO mentioned "The transition to a multi-product company, the importance of AI, and strengthening the role of UX and front end engineering have emerged more clearly for me as priorities." – It's sinking in!
