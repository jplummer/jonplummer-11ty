The lady is out of town, but

- I'm mostly eating right anyhow, in contrast with other such times

- Chauffeuring to and from ballet and other events has not been a problem (and I have people to help next week)

- The girl was interested in seeing Snarky Puppy with me on Tuesday, and it was a good show. No opener, right to the good stuff

- Nothing blew up while the one PM director was away, a credit to the team. Yay
