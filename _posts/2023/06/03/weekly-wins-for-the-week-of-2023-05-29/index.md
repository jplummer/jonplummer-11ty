Memorial Day made for a short week. Some folks can do about four day's effort in four days, others (managers especially) try to do all the things and pack five days of meetings into the four days, resulting in less space to get other things done, then wonder why they are un happy with the week's results.
- I didn't do that, this time. I did many of the meetings, but skipped some in favor of actually making stuff. Highly recommended.
- Huaraches for men for summer. [They're fab](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1286290385/brown-leather-shoes-for-men-made-in?ref=yr_purchases).
- I went for a 400lb deadlift and didn't get it, so 375 max. That's fineâ€¦for now.
- We heard of a problem we inadvertently introduced, proposed a fix, investigated the effect of the fix, and deployed the fix in the same day. That's definitely a step forward in customer-centricity.
