We heroically snuck up to Seattle by car late at night and then back the following night, thoroughly wearing ourselves out in the process. The traveling was exhausting and not fun, but…

- …the event itself, a surprise party for my mother’s 80th birthday, was a smashing success, thanks mainly to my sister-in-law, and…

- …I spoke well at the party.

- Apple announced the 15” version of the M2 MacBook Air I just bought, and it’s about the same price. Return, purchase, new new machine! (That’s why this post is late – the new machine needed to arrive so I could fire up LocalWP and export the site. Yes, you’re looking at a Wordpress-powered site, but just a static export of it, no actual WP running on the server, ‘cause that’d be slow and hackable. One day I’ll replace this canned theme with my own simplified one, maybe.)

- A coworker suffering from burnout opened up to me and I was able to help somewhat.

- Another coworker, this one skeptical of my department, brought me a project. We were able to quickly negotiate the scope and I have it in the hands of a capable designer who I’m sure will do a good job without gilding it or underdelivering out of an excess of hurry. I love it when a plan comes together.

- My chats about quality are starting to resonate, here and there. Plenty more to do, but it’s maybe sinking in.
