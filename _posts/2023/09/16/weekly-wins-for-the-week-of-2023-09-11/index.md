- One-time mentorship conversations are fun, and they remind me how I think about issues. So far everyone has been pleased with our conversations. [https://adplist.org/mentors/jon-plummer](https://adplist.org/mentors/jon-plummer) I wish I was as readily eloquent when it came to writing these posts.

- My knee is much more stable now than it was when it was irritated recently. This is only now that I have PT and ortho referrals coming up, of course. Murphy sometimes mistakenly interferes in a way that makes things a little better.

- If you need something done at a hospital, call the patient advocate. Changing the channel from email to phone, and changing the recipient from a barely-interested secretary to a person whose job it is to chase things down has produced enough of my chart from 31 years ago to greatly inform what's to come next, whatever that is. As I say often to the people I support, "f you aren't getting the engagement you want, try changing the channel."
