## Revision to goals for the quarter

> Step into responsiveness via the design system – propose to R&D why and a way forward to get us to accommodate actual user viewport sizes better, and get a resulting project onto the roadmap

I don't have the strongest opinion on this one and bucket it similarly to chipping away at general UX improvements. I don't want to dig the hole deeper – anything net new we develop would ideally have a higher bar of usability prior to general release – but would need to see specific examples with LOE of more general improvement candidates to weigh in.

> Improve the quality of UX delivery – establish Figma delivery conventions specifically intended to reduce the cognitive load on developers, with developer input and feedback, and pilot these new conventions

Strongly agree with this one and I appreciate how Jon scoped the specific action item this quarter.

> Advocate for an appropriate level of UX/UI polish to survive engineering delivery by spreading the UX review cycle currently piloted via Smart Alerts and Call Review projects to other teams/crews

Also in strong agreement here but with the most Q3 emphasis being on Call Review & Coaching-related projects if we had to prioritize where Jon spends his time.

> Advocate for and begin a project to do POC IAs for various user types to explore the sensibility and difficulty of separating \[product A\] and \[product B\]

We talked about modifying this one a bit as some of the groundwork on \[product B\] is in place. I let Jon know that I have a Q3 goal with \[PM\] to revamp the \[product A\] product vision/strategy which will surely need UX input as stakeholders and that ideally better defines where UX output can be helpful for \[product A\] future IA and candidates for usability improvement.​

## Values
- **Light The Customer's Way**: \[evident in\] the improvements we've made to UX quality in recent releases and stronger focus on customer adoption and usability.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Jon's involvement in many of the organizational & process improvements we've rolled out in recent months, ensuring UX had a seat at the table ahead of making these changes and providing his perspective that influenced the solutions we implemented.​

## Past Quarter's Results

Jon has done a fantastic job improving both the quality of UX output at Invoca and building buy-in for user/customer-centric activities. He receives positive feedback from cross-department stakeholders and I am grateful to have him leading UX efforts. Key examples of Jon's leveling up of UX in recent months:
- His participation at Dallas and May offsites, particularly the lead up to our leadership offsite and his help with material preparation and follow through.
- His very well-received Connect talk that summarized/connected the dots on many of the changes we had been looking to drive following our offsite discussions - trios, experimentation, shipping value/quality vs. speed, etc.
- Leveling up members on the UX team and helping define new shaping frameworks to set them up for success. Also, pushing the team to have more direct customer/user feedback sessions.I hope Jon recognizes how far we've come in a short time (no longer prioritizing by service area vs. customer needs) and I'm excited to continue the journey with him.

​2 – Right On Track
