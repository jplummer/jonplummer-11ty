- Good Friday Spring Holiday – this day off caught many at work by pleasant surprise.
- A chat with the SVP of Engineering reminded me that I'm overdue on publicizing and gathering support for the high-level version of my plan for the department. My goal for the week is set!
- While Swift syntax is distinctly weird to my "C-like" early Javascrip-trained eyes, plowing through the Apple-provided tutorials is helpful. Somewhat. Even so, the use/placement of dots in something like the following is distinctly odd to me:

```
VStack() {
	Image(systemName: "pin")
		.imageScale(.large)
		.foregroundColor(.accentColor)
	Text("Placeholder text for now")
}
.padding()
```

Yeah, I'm team tabs.
