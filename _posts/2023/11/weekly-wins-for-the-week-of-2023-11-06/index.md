I forgot that this week ended with Veterans Day. It's awesome to have an unexpected day off, which is really a day to get a handful of other things done. And I did â€“ I closed the to-do list for the day and most of tomorrow, had a lovely lunch with family, and the weekend is just beginning.

Meanwhile the confusion and "should"ing at work continues, but we have a leadership offsite coming and this situation has made my agenda clear for that meeting: "what do we mean by quality" and "what am I here to do." Smaller topics can be set aside for now.
