- A short work week is a beautiful thing. Having your entire department out for a day so you can catch up on administrative tasks is also nice, if a tad lonely.
- The dreaded "calibration meeting" where you explain your people's reviews to your peer managers (our first at this company, so likely to be a bit fraught) went just fine. No drama.
- Although my three vaccines set my night (and the following day) on fire, folks were understanding and I recovered quickly.
