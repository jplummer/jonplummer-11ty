Weekly wins seems to do its job, reminding me to remember what good is happening. Sometimes it is quiet.
- Two words: [LEGO Minibus](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/volkswagen-t2-camper-van-10279). It's a super fun set, though delicate in some areas (attachment of the front roof, attachment of the front bumper) and weirdly overbuilt in others (steering, pop-up roof). It's stuffed with enjoyable details like the refrigerator, tilting table, folding rear seat, cooktop, and boxer engine.
- Two words: holiday shutdown.
- I almost always type "weekly winds."
