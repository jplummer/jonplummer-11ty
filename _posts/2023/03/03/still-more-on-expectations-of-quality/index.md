The general idea is that **scope should scale but quality should not**. [All of these](/2023/02/02/quality-expectations/) are achievable in small scopes and if we care about quality are not “extra” costs.
- If it is not usable we will not learn what we hope to learn from an alpha or beta – our learning will be confounded by usability issues.
- If it is unpleasant to use, its uptake will be blunted.
- If it is not visually credible, confidence in its function will be blunted.
- If it contains needless toil its uptake will be blunted.
- If it is incomplete in the intended use cases it will seem broken.
- If it is incomplete in its states, messages, and errors for the covered use cases it will seem broken.
- If it is not obvious it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.
- If it is not self-explanatory it has poor usability and increases the cost of training, which is backward from what we plan to do.
- If it is poorly-labeled it is not usable. This is just a facet of usability that we should strive for in every delivery to live users.
