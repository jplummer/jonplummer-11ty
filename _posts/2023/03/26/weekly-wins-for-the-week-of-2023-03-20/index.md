It's spring break, that awkward nearly month-long period when employees with kids start disappearing for a week at a time. Every year the challenge is to make sure that people have prepared their teams for their absence; that enough is done and questions answered (and backup help secured) that whoever remains can proceed without much trouble, and especially that the person's absence doesn't come as a surprise.

When I asked each person this week "what do we need to do to prepare your team for your absence" each person's answer started with what they've already done. That's a big win.
