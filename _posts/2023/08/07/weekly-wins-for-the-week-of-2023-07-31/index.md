- It's amazing what even one day away, far from the home and the projects and the email, can do. We had planned a two-day trip but the first night fell through. No matter â€“ a night and a day exploring northern Oregon and the coast is time well-spent.
- I'm ready for my presentation! Or as ready as I'm likely to be. I have plenty of time to rehearse and do a little polishing. Accept the pressure to perform as a sign that you're excited and should prepare, then prepare. It took me a little longer than usual to get to this point, this time, but I'm here now.
- Just when I'm worried I'm not accomplishing enough my manager points out that he's happy to see the progress I'm making. Phew.
