- Quarterly coaching is done! Yay. There were no surprises, as expected. People offered and acknowledged their areas of grown, which is a good sign.
- I wrote a _screed_ in the R&D leadership Slack channel and it was well-received. Now I have to help put my complaint into operation; I feel renewed energy for that.
- I figured out how to avoid the "vapor lock" many reveal people experience when discussing a vast problem space. It's probably nothing new technique-wise, but already the discussions I'm having are more operationally useful than they were before because we're getting around the temptation to zoom out and hand-wave.
