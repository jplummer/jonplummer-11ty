title: "More on expectations of quality"

Just like the _false tradeoff_ between security and usability, I don’t want to play into the notion that light scope and quality are opposing forces. We will not make progress if we habitually shortchange quality. An “MVP” of poor experience quality is certainly “minimum” but forgets the “viable” and a bit of the “product.” You could say it is actually below "minimum." For another take on this, see Jason Cohen's [Simple, Lovable, Complete](https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html).
