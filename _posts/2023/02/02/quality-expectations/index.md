Be it version three or an MVP, the experience we deliver should

- be valuable to specific users

- be usable by those users

- conform to or enhance the user's understanding of the subject area

- be pleasant to use

- be visually polished

- deliver value in results and conveniences

- minimize toil

- be complete in its delivery of the uses we offer

- be complete in its states, messages, and errors

- make good use of familiar controls and interaction paradigms

- make success obvious

- be obvious in expected actions and right action

- be self-explanatory, relying on recognition rather than training and recall

- be well-labeled

- be instrumented so we can witness users' successes and difficulties

â€¦even if the scope is small, even if it's a little slice of functionality from a bigger, longer-term plan, even if it is a fragment of the excellent future we envision. Even the basics should be built completely, with thoughtfulness and pride.
