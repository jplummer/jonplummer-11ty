- The taxes are done. Never mind that the American tax system is needlessly difficult for the vast majority of taxpayers due in part to the political intervention of companies that make money off of this difficulty; the taxes are done.

- I have prepared for or delivered four of my five quarterly coaching/reviews. So far, so good.

- Another weekend, another dance competition or showcase. The girl did great as a "tall swan" in excerpts from Swan Lake! Lovely to see. And it was nice to stomp around North Bend and Coos Bay for a few hours. One thing you can typically find in maritime towns is old machine shops. No exception here. Fun window-peeping on the weekend!
