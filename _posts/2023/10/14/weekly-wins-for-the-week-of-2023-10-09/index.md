The month of October signals the end of the third quarter in our funny misaligned fiscal year. That's useful, in part because I promised some things by the end of the quarter, and a little push is a good thing. So,

- That little push helped me make progress with revamping a set of moribund customer profiles, and the latest increment of that work is now out for review. Thanks, October!

- I got out and plugged in and noodled on my keyboard (nothing fancy, just an M-Audio KeyStation plugged into Garage Band), filling in little obligatoes to the usual evening Spotify soundtrack. Good fun, and long overdue.

- Fancy pictures (MRI) of my knee reveal what seems a relatively simple explanation for the oddball problems I've been having and have been slowly worsening over years. (Can I afford the remedy? TBD.)
