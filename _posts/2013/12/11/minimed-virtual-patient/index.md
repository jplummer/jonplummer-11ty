As a demonstration and educational tool, and to preview to executives anticipated sensor data analysis capabilities, we made a Windows application that simulated three typical insulin-dependent diabetic patients. One could elect to be the physician, reviewing three days of the patient's recent history and making adjustments Â to insulin pump settings to improve their care, or choose to be the patient, selecting meals and insulin dosages over a two day period and seeing how your blood glucose responded to your choices.

My role: concept, interaction and visual design, patient selection and operationalization, and numerous demonstrations to executives, visiting endocrinologists, and community groups

Lessons learned: A skilled, flexible developer and a designer who listens can make an experiment into something special, if they are both grounded in the subject matter.
