So many things, in retrospect:

- Home progress!
    - Landscaping is done, trees are in
    
    - Storm drains are cleaned
    
    - The network is regularly providing 1200Mbps, after modernizing a bit (paid for by selling the slightly older equipment)

- Work progress!
    - The concept sprint I led was a resounding success – the execs wish they could sell our plan now, but they recognize they need to wait until they fund it and we build it – and there's talk of more
    
    - The pendulum is swinging back toward being more customer-centric

- Life progress!
    - I pulled 410 last week by doing the plate math wrong, and it was no problem at all
    
    - At my last appointment my PT said "good job;" I bet PTs don't say that often
