Work was…fine…this week. Lots of folks are out or about to be out and while there's a moment to try to wrestle projects and processes into shape there are not a lot of people to do that with; preparing projects to to bowl along while they are out is more pressing. But with the girl and the lady out of the house I was productive with home projects. In the last week I've

- sent a care package

- taken care of a library fine by finding and returning the book

- bought a copy of that same book, as a gift

- set up garage shelves and populated them

- moved the last of the boxes and tools from the neighbors' garage

- set up a greenhouse (shh, it's a surprise)

- reconnected with an old friend

- thrilled a nephew with birthday gifts

- installed missing trim on a piece of furniture

- installed a door stop on the door to the cat litter box area

- went to a baseball game

- had the tires replaced on a car that sorely needed it

- replaced wipers on that same car

- replaced antenna garnish on that same car

- washed a different car

- given myself a haircut

- put a hook on the back of the closet door

- built a credible trashcan of an unusual size for a specific installation

- found and replaced a furnace filter

- epoxied together the house numbers and their holding shape

- done some emergency laundry

- kept all the plants and cats alive
