Juneteenth National Independence Day was this last Wednesday. It was odd to have a holiday mid-week but

- Juneteenth is worth celebrating, worth remembering, worth considering in this political moment.

- I forgot that most of our walls are backed by plywood, so a towel bar installation I had put off was unexpectedly quick and dust-free.

- The newish head of engineering thanked me for my attention and care to our common (and coming) process fixes.

- The notion that we should (and that it makes economic sense to) focus on the things we can do that will help a lot of (and a lot of new) customers is starting to sink in among influential people. The notion that we should (and that it makes economic sense to) work a little harder so that our customers don't have to is taking a little more time, but I think we'll get there.
