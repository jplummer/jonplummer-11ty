As of nine weeks ago I have a new job at Cayuse. But how do I explain my accomplishments on LinkedIn when I'm so new?

Maybe I don't. What if I instead explain what I am there to do? What would that be like?

> I am building a design and research team to support the collection of 25+ disparate built and acquired products into a single coherent suite. Since I've recently begun, here's what I plan to accomplish:  
> • Develop UX and UI design capacity and capability  
> • Add and develop UX research capability  
> • Install formative usability testing during design to de-risk detailed design decisions  
> • Install user insights research, concept design and validation  
> • Stand up a team and processes to build and improve a design system in visuals and code, for the product suite  
> • Gather and improve product personas to be an informative smaller set of personas for the entire suite  
> • Begin instrumentation of new features, to measure outcomes, by determining desired outcomes at the epic level  
> • Help the product team take advantage of existing pre-customer and post-launch data, such as customer success contact data, support forum and knowledge base behavior, RFP mining, sales demo feedback, etc.

I suppose over time I could exchange some of these for my accomplishments and my new plan. I've not seen this anywhere else. Good idea? Bad idea?
