Heather asked me yesterday "who owns accessibility?" That's a fun question. I replied:

> Accessibility is not owned. Who owns quality? It's a team responsibility. To the extent that accessibility compliance, or release date, or the P&L is a "feature" of a piece of software it is owned by the PM, but each function has its responsibilities in accomplishing accessibility. Making these responsibilities explicit is necessary.

> If we are to be product-led and not sales-led, PM has to insist on it (and manage competing priorities), maybe that's part of the answer.

The "ownership" urge seems to sometimes dilute or deprioritize the responsibilities of others, which is a shame because we must work in concert.
