- While the team is sad at the departure of a great employee, they are holding together.
- I made less progress than I had hoped on my conference presentation scripts, but more than I was in danger of making, and I'll take that as a win.
- I wisely skipped a workout in favor of a friend's birthday party, and it was good to see here and some old friends from a prior job. We fell right in as if we'd never been out. It was nice. I've been "bad at social" for a little while and it is nice to be reminded that I'm not actually bad at social, I'm bad at getting around to asking for and scheduling it.
