You can file for time off in the relevant system and I'll approve it. It is important to give your product team at least as much warning so that you can help them adapt to your absence.  
  
The key things I expect here are:

1. advance warning if at all possible
2. file diligently (well before when warning is possible, right after if not)
3. provide the same level of warning to your team
4. negotiate well in advance with your team what to do to make sure things bowl along in your absence (you have things ready, what slack will others need to take up, what can wait for your return)
5. ask for help if needed
6. negotiate one week in advance with your team what to do to make sure things bowl along in your absence
7. ask for help if needed
8. check on how things went once you return and negotiate the new way forward from there (given that conditions may have changed)
9. ask for help if needed

In general I think of filing for PTO as a "vacation warning" rather than a "vacation request."
