"Cold" applications to Director or VP of UX Design/Product Design jobs are going nowhere. Not a one has resulted in so much as a conversation with a recruiter. I'm zero for sixteen on these. Perhaps worse; I haven't kept careful count. BUT!
- "Warm" applications, where I've been referred by someone I already know or otherwise managed to network my way into discussing an opportunity, have resulted in initial conversations or informational interviews about a third of the time.
- Recruiter-led opportunities, where a recruiter approached me first, have been fewer, but have resulted in initial conversations or informational interviews three quarters of the time.
- Most of the networked or recruiter-led opportunities are rather more interesting than the cold ones.
- Get me into an interview with the hiring manager and we're off to the races. Whenever this has happened I've made progress through the interview schedule.

It's the network! Work the network.
