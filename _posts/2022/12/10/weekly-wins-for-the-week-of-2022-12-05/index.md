Pro leisure circuit is almost over; the new job begins on Monday.

- The new job begins on Monday! I have a new computer, it's not overly locked-down, and the tech onboarding process was smooth.

- I have formed a plan for the merger of my blog and portfolio, based in part on my earlier research about recruiters and hiring managers (win: having done the research!). Best of all it's not something I need to do all at once (win: planning and partializing!). There are several segments of this project that are useful on their own, and I've already done one of them. (UX people, turn your powers on yourself!)

- There's only one xmas gift yet to arrive, and it's optional. It's nice to be so close to done.
