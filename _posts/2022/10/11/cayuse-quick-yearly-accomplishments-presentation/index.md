In early October I was asked to give an [eight-to-ten-minute presentation](https://misc.jonplummer.com/portfolio/Quick%20UX%20accomplishments%202022%2010%2005.pptx) summing up the year for UX. A tall order, but I embraced blazing through the content to alight briefly on things I though the general company audience should know about UX and how we were trying to help.

With most of our work going toward rewrites that have not yet launched thereâ€™s little to say about outcomes, so I followed a rapid tour of our outputs with a couple of quick demos and an invitation to view my upcoming Cayuse Connect Conference talk about [UX philosophy and practice](https://jonplummer.com/2022/11/02/conference-talk-ux-philosophy/).
