There has been a lot of scuttlebutt about people secretly holding two jobs of late. This is partially due to a [labor market that remains tight, especially in tech](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3670596/tech-job-market-is-up-this-year.html), [publicity around fraudulent interviewees](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/business/jobs-hiring-fraud.html), and employees having more control over their time in remote and hybrid work environments, among other concerns. This has led to some [needlessly inflated rhetoric](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6986537924460785664-PxHd/) and managers comparing notes about how to [detect people who are working more than one job](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/09/is-there-a-way-to-find-out-if-someone-secretly-has-two-full-time-jobs.html).

I'm not that worried about it. The number of jobs an employee has is not my concern.

- If the person is getting their work done and meeting my performance/communication/availability standards, I don't have a problem.
- If they are not getting their work done and/or not meeting my performance/communication/availability standards, I do have a problem.

In neither case do I need to cast about for proof that the person is working another job or two, or distracted by caring for an elder parent, or going through a messy breakup, or what have you. I gain nothing by investigating each employee to see if they might be working another job. If I determine that there's a performance problem, I need to talk to the employee and manage the issue.

No one seems to care if an employee in the C-suite serves on multiple boards (unless they are competitors) or advises multiple startups (unless they are competitors). No one seems to care if an employee also plays in a band. No one seems to care if a person sells their ceramics or tunes pianos or works on software projects on the side for free; perhaps it's conflict of interest we're worried about?

If there's no performance problem and no conflict of interest, is there a problem?
