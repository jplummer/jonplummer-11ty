Three wins for this week:

1. Never mind my thoughts about NPS, which I have not written up here but should (edit: See "[The trouble with NPS](https://jonplummer.com/2022/07/31/the-trouble-with-nps/)"). Our company Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is **five**. Five is not terrible as it's above zero, but it's not something to crow about either. That of my team is **eighty**. If you're curious about eNPS, [Qualtrics has an okay writeup](https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/employee-net-promoter-score-enps-good-measure-engagement/). Our engagement scores reflect a similar difference, albeit a bit less grand.
2. Workouts this week, while at the same weights and only slightly higher volume than last week, were unexpectedly much harder. I did 'em anyhow. This might have something to do with the third win; while I've been losing weight slowly, I've also been losing energy slowly.
3. I started with a [nutrition coach](https://www.triplecrownhealth.com). I'm in the "write everything down and don't change anything" phase, prior to recommendations. I'm not jazzed about taking progress photos, but I **am** excited about having a knowledgeable person help me steer my habits toward my goal of being [above average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kViCSPXyU8U).

Have a good weekend.
