In early October I was asked to give an [eight-to-ten-minute presentation](https://misc.jonplummer.com/portfolio/Quick%20UX%20accomplishments%202022%2010%2005.pptx) summing up the year for UX. A tall order, but I embraced blazing through the content to alight briefly on things I though the general company audience should know about UX and how we were trying to help.

With most of our work going toward rewrites that have not yet launched there's little to say about outcomes, so I followed a rapid tour of our outputs with a couple of quick demos and an invitation to view my upcoming Cayuse Connect Conference talk about [UX philosophy and practice](https://jonplummer.com/2022/11/01/conference-talk-ux-philosophy/).
