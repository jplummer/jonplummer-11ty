I have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/jonplummer.io\/\">portfolio<\/a>&nbsp;that&#8217;s not super-duper up-to-date, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/jonplummer.com\/\">scratchpad of thoughts and notes<\/a>&nbsp;about design and design leadership and making.

I also have a handful of&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/patents.google.com\/?inventor=Jon+Plummer&amp;num=100\" target=\"_blank\">patents<\/a>&nbsp;in IoT, software, and medical device technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recommendations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Suzanne Hopkins<\/strong>, Director of Product Management, Cayuse<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon joining our team, Jon immediately made significant improvements to our team by building the framework for a design library. His logical thinking and pragmatic approach to process improvements and design were foundational in building a scalable framework for our team of Product Managers and UX designers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon also puts inclusion and team happiness at the core of building his team. He could always be counted on to provide a non-biased, inclusive view to our leadership conversations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, Jon is a strong, compassionate leader who is an asset to any leadership team. I welcome any opportunity to work with Jon in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Jamie Bolton<\/strong>, UX Design Manager, Linksys<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon is a steady leader. I worked as a UX Designer for Jon at Belkin. At that time, Jon led the UX department for 3 brands, Belkin, Linksys, and Wemo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He created a centralized UX department that had a strong UX culture. Our workflow included healthy exchanges of ideas during design critique, retro after releases, and agility with every project. He is organized and goals-driven. His enviable writing skills led to many clear design objectives and tasks for the team. Goals were inspiring, and constraints were defined sensibly. He often gave feedback by asking questions which lets you arrive at the answer on your own &#8211; a great teaching technique!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We worked in a highly technical industry, and while it was difficult at times to marry design and technology, he was skilled at distilling networking complexities into digestible information. Often, he fought for users in a highly technical environment with high tension and stakes. He always remained the mature one in the room \u2013 calm and objective to achieve what was necessary. His organizational leadership is top-notch, and while it\u2019s been a few years since Jon and I worked together, I still learn from him as my mentor. He is very patient with me as I step into his shoes and try to navigate the product design space as a leader, a path he put me on when he promoted me to Design Manager years ago. I am grateful to Jon for trusting in me. He is a fantastic friend who takes time out of his day to get you to think of situations in different ways, which ultimately brings out the best outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Angelica Bunyi<\/strong>, Product Designer, Datto<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon is an extremely thoughtful and caring leader who is always willing to support his team in any way that he can. On top of his deep knowledge and expertise in UX, Jon has an amazing ability to foster a work environment of open communication and trust. When working on challenging projects, I always felt comfortable asking him for advice and never felt like I was asking a &#8220;dumb question&#8221;. Despite being spread thin across different projects, Jon was always engaged and asked insightful questions to help define and shape ambiguous client requests and projects. I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from Jon early in my UX career. His guidance and mentorship the past few years has made me a more confident designer and any team would be beyond lucky to have him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(There are more recommendations on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jplummer\/details\/recommendations\/\">my LinkedIn profile<\/a>.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"awards\">Awards<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>International Design Excellence Awards, Finalist<\/strong>&nbsp;Issued by Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA), Aug 2013, for WeMo iOS app<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>User Experience Award: Silver<\/strong>&nbsp;for Best Consumer Device Issued by User Experience Awards, May 2013, for WeMo by Belkin<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>International Design Excellence Awards, Silver<\/strong>&nbsp;Issued by Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA), Sep 2012, for Belkin Next Generation Router Family<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"patents\">Patents<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/patents\/US8499072\">Self-healing networking device systems and related methods<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/patents\/US9179105\">Control of video camera with privacy feedback<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/patents\/US20060272652\">Virtual patient software system for educating and treating individuals with diabetes<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/google.com\/patents\/US20070033074A1\">Therapy management system<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/google.com\/patents\/US20160043962A1\">Grouping of networking devices<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/google.com\/patents\/US20150382436A1\">Light switch controlling light source via wireless transmission<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/google.com\/patents\/US20150319046A1\">Controlling settings and attributes related to operation of devices in a network<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/google.com\/patents\/US20160105598A1\">Video camera with privacy<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/google.com\/patents\/US20110026205A1\">Networking connection systems and related methods<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/google.com\/patents\/US20160226732A1\">Systems and methods for interaction with an IoT device<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/google.com\/patents\/US20160165570A1\">Crowd-sourced location determination<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2026and more patents pending in networking and IoT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>See more via&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/jplummer\" target=\"_blank\">my LinkedIn profile<\/a>, and message me there if you have something to say.
