It was an amazing trip, but we had a variety of mishaps with the trailer along the way. High winds carried off our radio antenna, we struggled with a blockage in the sewage tank, the toilet valve started to leak (not in a gross way), we lost a rivet inside, the awning started to spring back sluggishly and then not at all, we blew out a backflow preventer leading to a flood of fresh water coming out from behind the kitchen cabinet, etc. And in the very last days of the trip our 12-year-old sewer hose finally started to crack, leading to a small but unpleasant situation when we went to dump our waste water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, once we arrived home we cleaned things up as best we could and made an appointment with our local service provider. Once I started to explain our list of issues they smartly asked me to email the list, which I did, explained in detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drop off day arrived, and I dutifully explained each issue to the service writer, who had prepared a repair order based on the email. The service writer said he thought my explanations, email, and the repair order all made sense, and I handed him the keys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weeks passed, and I received a call saying the repairs were complete. We made an appointment for me to pick up the trailer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">That brings us to today<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today was pick up day, but I returned home empty-handed. All of the repairs were done satisfactorily but one: I had neither a new sewer hose nor a carrier to match. All that was done was to replace screws needed to hold the existing carrier in place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking over the repair order, line two had only the instructions<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Longer sewer outlet hose with carrier<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Those aren&#8217;t bad instructions, actually. If they had been fulfilled, I&#8217;d have taken the trailer home. Instead, the trailer still had the original hose and carrier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently the next size hose carrier is 64 inches long (162.5 science units) and there was only 62 inches of unobstructed space across the trailer to install a carrier, so the technician spotted and fixed what they could see as wrong, missing screws. They took a note to this effect<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Currently has 47&#8243; hose carrier, only has max 62&#8243; space for different carrier. Replaced two missing screws from carrier<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>and stopped work. The effect of this is that the most important part of my problem, needing a new sewer hose, was not remedied, and the least important, this too-short hose carrier being loose, was all that was worked on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What went wrong?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I can think of a handful of different things that someone could have done to improve the situation. But the most charitable interpretation is that my goal<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>new sewer outlet hose and a carrier to match, or just a new sewer outlet hose<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>didn&#8217;t make it to the technician. I probably have a hand in that miss, as does the service writer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There also might be a little bit of <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/2012-09-07\/ty-article\/word-of-the-day-rosh-gadol\/0000017f-e66d-dc7e-adff-f6ed883b0000\">rosh gadol<\/a><\/em> at work here; come to find out also that I&#8217;m not stuck with my too-short 47 inch carrier or a too-long 64 inch carrier \u2013 there are adjustable hose carriers. And surely a technician can select a carrier, adjust it to a suitable length, test a new hose to see if it will fit, and finding a match install both and sell them to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(It also probably did not help that my expression of the goal included an &#8220;or.&#8221;) <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The remedy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I told the service writer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>My goal is to have a new sewer hose, and the means to carry it, installed on the trailer.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The exact manner of meeting that goal is open to interpretation, but if that goal makes it to the technician this time I&#8217;m confident I will have the result I seek.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bottom line A small incident today reminds me of the importance of explaining not just what action you&#8217;d like taken but why.
