It&#8217;s even harder to follow an instruction when it relies on a metaphor, as it&#8217;s less clear, less obvious, less instructive. The combination of negatively-worded and unclear is worse yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should have asked clarifying questions, like &#8220;what would it feel like if I was treating you as a steering wheel?&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t think to at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At work we just did a retro on a somewhat fraught and over-large project, and much of the raw conclusions are negatively-worded. Some are metaphorical. The people involved are knowledgeable but from different disciplines, so the level of shared understanding is probably lower than people guess. So a lot of &#8220;don&#8217;t do X, don&#8217;t do Y&#8221; will probably not get the results we seek. I&#8217;ll be helping to bend these into positively-worded instructions today. I suspect our success will depend on it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The first time I rode a motorcycle I was on the back, clinging to my college roommate.
