It&#8217;s a bit tricky as I left one job without gathering visuals and that company no longer exists. It&#8217;s a bit complicated by the fact that at my prior job nearly all of the team&#8217;s effort went into rewrites that have not yet shipped, so have not borne results.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some of my target companies are going through layoffs right now, but there are plenty of other opportunities out there.
