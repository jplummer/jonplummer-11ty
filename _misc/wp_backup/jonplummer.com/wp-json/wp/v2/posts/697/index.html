I don&#8217;t want to dig the hole deeper \u2013 anything net new we develop would ideally have a higher bar of usability prior to general release \u2013 but would need to see specific examples with LOE of more general improvement candidates to weigh in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Improve the quality of UX delivery \u2013 establish Figma delivery conventions specifically intended to reduce the cognitive load on developers, with developer input and feedback, and pilot these new conventions<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Strongly agree with this one and I appreciate how Jon scoped the specific action item this quarter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Advocate for an appropriate level of UX\/UI polish to survive engineering delivery by spreading the UX review cycle currently piloted via Smart Alerts and Call Review projects to other teams\/crews<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in strong agreement here but with the most Q3 emphasis being on Call Review &amp; Coaching-related projects if we had to prioritize where Jon spends his time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Advocate for and begin a project to do POC IAs for various user types to explore the sensibility and difficulty of separating [product A] and [product B]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked about modifying this one a bit as some of the groundwork on [product B] is in place. I let Jon know that I have a Q3 goal with [PM] to revamp the [product A] product vision\/strategy which will surely need UX input as stakeholders and that ideally better defines where UX output can be helpful for [product A] future IA and candidates for usability improvement.\u200b<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Values<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Light The Customer&#8217;s Way<\/strong>: [evident in] the improvements we&#8217;ve made to UX quality in recent releases and stronger focus on customer adoption and usability.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Continuous Improvement<\/strong>: Jon&#8217;s involvement in many of the organizational &amp; process improvements we&#8217;ve rolled out in recent months, ensuring UX had a seat at the table ahead of making these changes and providing his perspective that influenced the solutions we implemented.\u200b<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Past Quarter&#8217;s Results<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon has done a fantastic job improving both the quality of UX output at Invoca and building buy-in for user\/customer-centric activities. He receives positive feedback from cross-department stakeholders and I am grateful to have him leading UX efforts. Key examples of Jon&#8217;s leveling up of UX in recent months:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>His participation at Dallas and May offsites, particularly the lead up to our leadership offsite and his help with material preparation and follow through.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>His very well-received Connect talk that summarized\/connected the dots on many of the changes we had been looking to drive following our offsite discussions &#8211; trios, experimentation, shipping value\/quality vs. speed, etc.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leveling up members on the UX team and helping define new shaping frameworks to set them up for success. Also, pushing the team to have more direct customer\/user feedback sessions.I hope Jon recognizes how far we&#8217;ve come in a short time (no longer prioritizing by service area vs. customer needs) and I&#8217;m excited to continue the journey with him.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200b2 \u2013 Right On Track<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(Quotations are my words, all else are the words of my manager.)
