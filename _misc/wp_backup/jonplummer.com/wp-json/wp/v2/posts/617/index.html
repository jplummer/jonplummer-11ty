I believe this overall area should continue to be Jon&#8217;s Q2 focus while begining to take steps to evangelize and show off results of UX output to stakeholders. We discussed a few ideas such as Trios sharing\/demoing their work in settings like Invocation, CKO, Company Connect. Jon &amp; team have also started using Lattice to publicly praise good work in Slack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other candidates for UX growth discussed:<br>* Building out UX personas\/profiles under &#8216;business centers&#8217; &#8211; to be used both in product development and by the organization to be more customer-centric and raise the visibility of UX.<br>* Building muscles as a trio and working projects in scoped iterations en route to GA vs. larger chunks shipped.<br>* Removing barriers or reliance on PM\/others for UX to get more direct interaction with customers; having UX lead respective customer sessions (and bringing insights back to the teams) vs. being in the passenger seat.<br>* Jon &amp; team potentially spending more time learning the product in conjunction with projects and their focus areas in the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also want to call out the good work Jon has done building trust and goodwill with the &#8216;First Team&#8217; in R&amp;D. I hope we can continue to focus on problems and improvement areas collectively (being open to sharing in the leadership Slack channel, etc) and use 1:1 discussions as warranted vs. the way to solve problems.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty good?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve shared this verbatim with my team and pointed out how it will affect our work in the coming quarter.
