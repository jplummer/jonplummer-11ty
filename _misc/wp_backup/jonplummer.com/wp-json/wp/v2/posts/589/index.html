I go double-overhand as long as I can, switching to a mixed grip once the bar starts to slip out of my hands. That used to happen around the end of the work sets; this week I got all the way to the final &#8220;legitimately heavy&#8221; set before having to switch grips. Getting better!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I finally managed to schedule some unpleasant diagnostic things I had been avoiding, a volunteer stint at the school district, shoulder PT, and close a lingering needless account by riding the momentum of just getting started. Just chipping off a chunk of a big problem and getting started is an underappreciated skill. (And it&#8217;s astonishing how deeply broken the US healthcare system is even for someone as healthy as I seem to be.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The people I support are visibly responding to my coaching.
