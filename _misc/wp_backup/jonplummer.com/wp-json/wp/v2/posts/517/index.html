Back to school! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>I had good workouts this week. I&#8217;m going heavy, pushing the intensity, and I can tell the day after, but it&#8217;s not coming with the little injuries and issues that it once did. I&#8217;m adapting.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I let my diet go a bit (a bit?) during the holiday break and have not been that quick to come back to plan, but things are fine. I could do better at getting enough protein, and my discipline with sugar is a bit off, but nothing terrible. I&#8217;ve noticed that unless I need to report my diet to someone it&#8217;s a lot harder to keep up with logging, and thus staying on plan. It doesn&#8217;t make rational sense, but it makes emotional sense. Renting accountability is a thing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The good meetings with good people at work continue \u2013 including a refreshing chat with the CEO. I remembered to ask him how <strong>he<\/strong> would notice if I accomplished the transformation we are hoping for, and he had an answer <strong>and<\/strong> a promise to think more deeply about it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The real question will be whether or not this transformation and the attendant results are contradicted somehow by coming <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OKR\" target=\"_blank\">OKRs<\/a>. Since the company is new to OKRs there&#8217;s widespread fear that each important thing that should be done will be crowded out if it doesn&#8217;t directly and strongly map to an OKR. The reason this is a win is that it represents the company trying to <strong>focus<\/strong> more, which is better than the all-too-common alternative to <strong>try harder<\/strong>. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Back to work!
