That&#8217;s a great sign; continued customer contact and analysis across those customers, rather than specific attention to any one of them, is driving this simplification.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Simplification \u2013 learning about the sales process with another leader from R&amp;D is causing us to explore simpler ways of trialing our product. And we had a breakthrough idea this week that will further simplify what we are prototyping, mostly taking the actual product and its attendant complexity out of the picture. This&#8217;ll be cheap to try and could lead in so many interesting directions that it&#8217;s really exciting.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Teamwork \u2013 the UX team is swarming on a key set of usability and capability improvements for our growth product, and it&#8217;s going well. The newest member of the team, from a design process and output standpoint, is running rings around one of the more senior members. It&#8217;s nice to see the development.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I stopped procrastinating on a thing, and now the thing is moving well.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The health scare has passed.
