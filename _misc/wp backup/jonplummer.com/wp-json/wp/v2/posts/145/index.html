But I am thinking about how best to apply the process maturity scorecard to the work of the individual designers to try to coach them on their projects. If a designer is helping to improve the process maturity of their product team(s), that&#8217;s a good sign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, some anti-metrics (trouble indicators) are pretty obvious \u2013 if there&#8217;s a lot of rework coming back to a designer, if deliverables are sloppy, if product managers and engineers are dissatisfied or under-involved, then we can tell there is a problem. But the opposite of these are not great metrics for individual performance, as a certain amount of rework will be technically driven, we don&#8217;t want to create an inspection-heavy situation where each deliverable is scrutinized for lack of sloppiness, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have expectations that designers will bring work to and contribute to critique, seek my counsel on design challenges, press for collaboration, etc. But do I want to count these behaviors? Probably not.<br>The ideal thing would be to peg team performance to the product metrics we hope to install. The metrics we really care about are user success metrics in a product, and these are team metrics, not individual performance metrics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when it comes time to evaluate a designer, I like to use four Cs \u2013 customer, collaboration, culture, and content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Customer<\/strong> \u2013 is the work produced by the designer informed by the customer, appropriate to the customer, accepted by the customer?<ol><li><em>Informed<\/em> a leading indicator, evidenced by their participation in research and testing. They are or are not doing this. Exactly how much is situational, nonnumeric.<\/li><li><em>Appropriate<\/em> is somewhat evident in testing, and ultimately evident in adoption, a lagging indicator (and highly dependent on product and engineering decisions, the appropriateness of the feature idea in the first place, etc.).<\/li><li><em>Accepted<\/em> is essentially adoption. The same caveats apply.<\/li><\/ol><\/li><li><strong>Collaboration<\/strong> \u2013 is the designer an effective collaborator on their project teams? Do they work well with their peers and their project teams?<\/li><li><strong>Culture<\/strong> \u2013 what is the designer&#8217;s contribution to the culture? Are they intellectually and emotionally engaged in a way that improves their teams and the org, is neutral, or detracts from their teams and the org? Are they improving and helping the culture improve?<\/li><li><strong>Content<\/strong> \u2013 is the designer&#8217;s work organized, communicative, complete, insightful, timely? Are their skills and attention to detail usefully on display in their work?<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The best articles out there about measuring designer performance are a) not very good and b) old, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/uxcellence.com\/2016\/measuring-designer-performance\">Measuring Designer Performance<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-do-I-create-KPIs-for-my-design-team\">How do I create KPIs for my design team<\/a>.
