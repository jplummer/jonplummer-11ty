When you get to the image, what would you say to help the listener understand the point the page is making?&#8221;<\/p>\n<cite>[name redacted 3]<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2026as well as complaints that Gov.uk is &#8220;canceling the alt tag&#8221; and other alarmist conclusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gov.uk&#8217;s advice is actually pretty good, if a bit high-level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <em>should<\/em> provide alternate content for anything that is not text or cannot be read by a screen reader and that is important to the meaning of the page \u2013 for example, if the image were missing or broken the page\u2019s meaning or intelligibility would be diminished \u2013 and should <em>not<\/em> provide alternate content for anything that can be safely left out without diminishing that meaning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few ways to provide alternate content; the\u00a0<code>alt<\/code>\u00a0attribute is one of them. It appears that\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/gov.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">gov.uk<\/a>\u00a0is expressing in part that the\u00a0<code>alt<\/code>\u00a0attribute is a less accessible way of presenting that alternate content than simply putting that alternate content right into the page, and that\u2019s true: a person who needs the content in the\u00a0<code>alt<\/code>\u00a0attribute but doesn&#8217;t use a screen reader (such as a person using a magnifier) will have to do some extra work to dig that content out of the\u00a0<code>alt<\/code>\u00a0attribute that a screen reader user would not need to do. That person would be helped if the alternate content were in the page, and no one else would be inconvenienced by this change.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[name redacted] writes: UK Gov websites dropping support for alt text fields and giving odd advice about what screen reader users want is making the rounds on Linkedin&nbsp;https:\/\/insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk\/2023\/08\/10\/making-it-easier-to-add-images-on-gov-uk\/ Naturally this has been met with many hot takes, including bizarre, especially given that i have often heard the uk gov is a good example of taking&hellip; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/2023\/09\/08\/gov-uk-recommends-not-using-alt-text-its-actually-a-good-idea\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Gov.uk recommends NOT using alt text.
