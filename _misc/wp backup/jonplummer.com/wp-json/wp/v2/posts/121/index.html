Focusing on and reacting to the apparent constraints in a situation can lead to a poor solution and a feeling of being stuck with that poor solution, a double-whammy of negativity. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t do X because of A, we couldn&#8217;t do Y because of B, so we&#8217;re stuck with Z, like it or not.&#8221; Chances are good that there&#8217;s a way to meet the goal that manages or makes irrelevant these constraints that you&#8217;ll be happier with than where you are seemingly stuck, but it requires exploring ways to meet the goal rather than rattling around in a box of obstacles.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Steven Forth responded:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Are there skills we can cultivate that helps us escape from the self-imposed constraints of constraint based thinking?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So I elaborated a bit:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Sure. Some are implied above.<br><br>1) Identify and articulate a <em>goal<\/em> as a <em>benefit<\/em> (where a benefit is the happy result NOT expressed in terms of exactly how it is delivered).<br><br>2) Consider a person&#8217;s needs and a business&#8217;s needs together rather than separately.<br><br>3) When confronted with a problem or pain point, learn about and offer possible benefits (some folks call them &#8220;gain points&#8221;) rather than solutions, at first. Later you can design or select a way to deliver that benefit.<br><br>4) Think in scenarios: <em>who<\/em> arrives in <em>what<\/em> situation, <em>when<\/em> and <em>where<\/em>, with <em>which<\/em> need or goal to address or accomplish, and <em>what<\/em> can the system (or organization, etc.) offer them?<br><br>Note that most of these thoughts require a <em>positive wording<\/em> of the situation or aim rather than a <em>negative wording<\/em>. This might be the key skill, broadly useful but not sufficient on its own. You&#8217;ll see this in health fields when practitioners take a wellness perspective\u2014rather than cease some harmful behavior like smoking, they&#8217;ll talk about replacing the habits associated with smoking with healthier rituals, moving nicotine delivery to a less-harmful medium where it can be managed, etc.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many other good comments there.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the Design Thinking group on LinkedIn, Sara Berm\u00fadez asked: I would love to hear your opinions on which are the most important mindsets for the future of work.
