Sometimes lowering your sights slightly can pay off. Yet I also feel I accomplished more than recent weeks. It&#8217;s probably a combination of smaller, more accomplishable (therefore likely better-defined) objectives and actual progress on a thing that&#8217;s been lingering for a while. We&#8217;ll see if this is a trick or a technique.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Having to explain my thoughts about product research\/design\/development to folks I work with, and having them ask me to operationalize parts of it they don&#8217;t fully understand, has led me to explaining some of the concepts from new angles. This is challenging my thinking and helping me to firm it up.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I had a lovely chat with a person who is contemplating moving from designer to design manager. I find this sort of thing rewarding because I like helping, and I like meeting people, and because it reminds me of what I&#8217;ve learned, what I think, and to listen first. It&#8217;s tempting to opine, but only valuable lightly and if that opinion is actually relevant to the person&#8217;s situation or question.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/535"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=535"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/535\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":539,"href":"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/535\/revisions\/539"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=535"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=535"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=535"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
