Difficult because the working of the deal puts an awkward gap in whatever plans you have together, and so you must dodge, delay, make excuses. Difficult because if the deal falls through you&#8217;ll have to pick up the pieces and paper over breakage caused by these gaps. Few will know why or what happened, just that you were unaccountably ineffective for a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankless because when the deal does happen all of your vagueness during the gap will be revealed as lies, lies that people won&#8217;t understand, lies that hurt to tell as you told them and hurt again as the people you deceived bark at you for deceiving them. Which you had to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankless too because any negative consequence of the deal, however indirect, is also on your head. Your reputation among those affected <em>will<\/em> be harmed. And yet it was probably the right thing to have done, to pursue the acquisition, to draw investment toward the idea that you gathered these people together to work on, or you would not have done it.
