For Western Governors University we were working on a new internal tool to manage rich skill descriptors (RSDs), but worked on a complete pattern library up front to speed our own development of the first version of the tool and enable rapid improvements in subsequent projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Central to this effort was the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/misc.jonplummer.com\/portfolio\/WGU%20acceptance%20criteria%20for%20patterns.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Acceptance Criteria for Patterns<\/a> document pictured here. The document included a block diagram of a typical page, followed by descriptions of the form and expected behavior of each pattern, and which smaller patterns each larger pattern incorporates. Each pattern also links the corresponding part of the design system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot2022-11-11at3.30.55PM-960x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot2022-11-11at3.30.55PM-960x1024.png 960w, https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot2022-11-11at3.30.55PM-281x300.png 281w, https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot2022-11-11at3.30.55PM-768x819.png 768w, https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot2022-11-11at3.30.55PM-1440x1536.png 1440w, https:\/\/jonplummer.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot2022-11-11at3.30.55PM.png 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The document serves as a reference to front- and back-end developers and QA, and greatly sped the production of shared code and the subsequent testing of the views and workflows produced.
