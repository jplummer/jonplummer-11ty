But once you\u2019ve done that, consider that our users are also suffering a form of the paper cut tax since they need to (and due to the tax are told to) see their CSMs about every little thing they want to change on the platform. Poor usability is a brake on their productivity and, in turn, a brake on their esteem for our company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story I am told regularly is that usability in existing interfaces hasn\u2019t been addressed because it is hard to relate to ROI. That\u2019s true. That also does not make it less important. As we do with other types of issues, I think we should devote a percentage of our collective effort to chipping away at the large experience debt we have in the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A small but potentially high-signal example: yesterday a few UXers including me attended \u201cMastering the Basics,\u201d a webinar meant to introduce new customers to a handful of typical operations on the platform. It was lengthy and dense, intelligibility issues were apparent (nay, obvious) at every turn, and two common refrains punctuated the talk: \u201csee your CSM for help with this\u201d and \u201cremember, \u2018campaign\u2019 has nothing to do with your actual marketing campaign but refers to call treatment\u201d (paraphrased). The latter was mentioned seven times in a short period; clearly it is a response to a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see \u201csee your CSM for help with this\u201d as an admission; \u201cwe know there\u2019s a problem.\u201d This is a sensible thing to say in our current state, and a bad look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it is broken\u201d is said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it\u201d is not. \u201cRemember, \u2018campaigns\u2019 has nothing to do with your actual marketing campaign but refers to call treatment\u201d is also an unwitting admission: \u201cthis system wasn\u2019t made for you and it is your problem to remember the odd words it uses.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would it take to, say, change \u201ccampaigns\u201d to \u201ccall treatments?\u201d Would the customers that actually use the term \u201ccampaigns\u201d in this way be put out by such a change? Have we asked? Just a thought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incoming employees recognize the problem. When I sought feedback for M\u2014 recently, D\u2014 mentioned \u201c\u2026for the UX team a great emphasis can be made on owning the UX of the platform not just for the new initiatives but for the existing features.\u201d We\u2019d love to, and to do so we need your help and participation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This article is worth a read as-is.
