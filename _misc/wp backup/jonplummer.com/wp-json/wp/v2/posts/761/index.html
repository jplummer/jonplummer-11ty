So our process, the design of our organization, needs to be arranged such that this is what the machine produces. We&#8217;re not trying to ship a little bit of engineering, a little bit of design, a little bit of support, and a little bit of product management all shaken up in a bag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t offer a UX process. I talk about what the product development team needs to do informationally to get from the customer need to the satisfaction of that need. You&#8217;ve heard this before from me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Benefit<\/strong>: What benefit do our customers need? What problem are we solving?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Concept<\/strong>: What concepts can we come up with to deliver that benefit? Which concept should we deliver? How should it work?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Detail<\/strong>: How should it work specifically? As we work on this are we maintaining or improving usability, intelligibility, functionality, appeal?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>In Use<\/strong>: Are users successful in using it? How might we help them be more successful?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll note that &#8220;In Use&#8221; folds right back into &#8220;Benefit&#8221; and the cycle continues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The specifics of each informational phase might be organization-specific, but you&#8217;ll need to harness all of the faculties of the product development organization, including (but not limited to) product management, design, engineering, customers, and users to do a good job in each phase. So this should be a single, integrated process.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My current employer is much like others in that it has a product management process, an engineering process, a design process, a customer onboarding process, a customer support process, etc. What do you notice?
