## When writing web front-end code

- Prefer semantic HTML with as few non-semantic elements as possible and sparing use of classes and IDs.
- Prefer vanilla CSS with common values pulled out into custom properties.
- ALWAYS use design tokens (CSS custom properties) if present.
    - Before using hardcoded values for font sizes, line heights, spacing, colors, or other design values, check all CSS files for existing custom properties.
    - Use tokens (e.g., `--font-size-xxs`, `--spacing-sm`, `--text-color`) instead of magic numbers or hardcoded values.
- Include alt text for all non-decorative images.
    - If information would be lost by not displaying an image, it needs alt text.
    - If an image is purely decorative, use an empty alt attribute.
    - No image should lack an alt attribute.
- Consider accessibility, but add ARIA attributes sparingly, preferring the natural behavior of semantic HTML elements in the browser where adequate.
- Prefer as little JavaScript as possible, and let's discuss when there's good reason before implementing any needed capabilities in JavaScript.
- Use mobile-first responsive design.
- Ask me if color contrast seems insufficient.
