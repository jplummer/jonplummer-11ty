## 11ty-specific

- Prefer Nunjucks (.njk) for templates.
- Follow the established _posts/YYYY/ directory structure for posts.
- Include required front matter: title, date, layout, tags (posts must include `post` in tags array).
- Use ISO date format: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss-HH:mm".

### 🔍 CRITICAL: Debugging Unexpected Behavior

**When encountering unexpected behavior, follow the debugging workflow:**

1. **ASSUME ELEVENTY IS WORKING CORRECTLY** - Most "bugs" are misunderstandings of Eleventy's behavior
2. **See `.cursor/rules/eleventy-debugging.mdc`** - This contains the systematic debugging process
3. **Use Eleventy's debug mode** - Run `DEBUG=Eleventy* pnpm run build` to see what Eleventy is doing
4. **Only then consider custom code** - After verifying Eleventy doesn't provide this, ask user before implementing

**Common mistake**: Writing workarounds for behavior that is actually Eleventy working as designed.
