## Testing Requirements

### 🔍 CRITICAL: Testing is Part of Every Change

**When making any change, testing considerations are required, not optional.**

1. **Before implementing a change:**
   - Identify which existing tests (if any) will validate this change
   - Determine if new tests are needed or existing tests need updates
   - Consider what could break and how to verify it doesn't

2. **During implementation:**
   - If adding new functionality, consider what tests should cover it
   - If modifying existing code, verify existing tests still pass
   - If fixing a bug, add or update tests to prevent regression

3. **After implementation:**
   - Run relevant tests to verify the change works
   - Run `pnpm run test fast` for quick validation
   - Consider whether the change affects build output (HTML, RSS, etc.) and test accordingly

### Test Suite Overview

**Fast tests** (run frequently): `html`, `links`, `internal-links`, `frontmatter`, `markdown`, `spell`, `seo`, `og-images`, `rss`, `indexnow`

**Slow tests** (run occasionally): `a11y`

**Other tests**: `deploy`, `security`

### Testing by Change Type

- **Content changes** (posts, pages): Run `pnpm run test changed` or specific tests (`spell`, `markdown`, `frontmatter`, `seo`)
- **Template/layout changes**: Run `pnpm run build` then `pnpm run test html`, `pnpm run test seo`
- **Script changes**: Run relevant functional tests, verify scripts execute correctly
- **Configuration changes**: Run `pnpm run test fast` to catch regressions
- **Build output changes**: Run `pnpm run test html`, `pnpm run test rss`, `pnpm run test og-images`

### When to Add New Tests

- New validation rules or checks
- New content types or structures
- New build outputs or formats
- New scripts or utilities that need verification
- **Authoring errors discovered**: When a user error in content authoring is found, create a test to catch similar mistakes in the future
- **External system issues**: When interacting with outside systems (APIs, services, dependencies) that are fragile, unreliable, or change unexpectedly, add tests to detect when they break or change behavior

### Defensive Testing: Learning from Errors

**When fixing issues, especially authoring mistakes or external system problems, create repeatable tests:**

1. **Authoring errors**: If a content mistake is discovered (wrong frontmatter format, broken markdown, missing required fields, etc.), add a test that would have caught it
2. **External dependencies**: If an external system (API, service, library update) causes issues, add tests that verify expected behavior and will fail if the system changes unexpectedly
3. **Make tests repeatable**: Tests should run automatically and catch the same issue if it happens again

**Example**: If a post is published with invalid frontmatter that breaks the build, add a test case that validates that specific pattern and would have caught the error.

**If unsure which tests to run, default to `pnpm run test fast` for comprehensive validation.**
